# Karpathy_LSTM_Classification

They are several goals for those notebooks. First, we are trying to reproduce the results of Karpathy (http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/ ) on recursive neural network. He proposed to use an LSTM network to perform a prediction task on differents texts data
