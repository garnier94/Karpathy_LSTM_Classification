When will the Radical Left Wing Media apologize to me for knowingly getting the Russia Collusion Delusion story so wrong? The real story is about to happen! Why is @nytimes @washingtonpost @CNN @MSNBC allowed to be on Twitter &amp; Facebook. Much of what they do is FAKE NEWS!

I have no doubt that if the attack on Dr. Ford was as bad as she says charges would have been immediately filed with local Law Enforcement Authorities by either her or her loving parents. I ask that she bring those filings forward so that we can learn  date time and place!

Great Job  Rachel Campos-Duffy on @foxandfriends.
Sleazy Adam Schiff the totally biased Congressman looking into "Russia" spends all of his time on television pushing the Dem loss excuse!
China just announce the there economy is growing much slower than anticipated because of our Trade War with them. They have just suspended U.S. Tariff Hikes. U.S. is doing very well. China wants to make a big and very comprehensive deal. It could happen and rather soon!
The Fake News Media is doing everything possible to stir up and anger the pols and as many people as possible seldom mentioning the fact that the Mueller Report had as its principle conclusion the fact that there was NO COLLUSION WITH RUSSIA. The Russia Hoax is dead!
'Small business optimism soars after Trump election' 
....More and more states want to do this but their governors and leaders don‚Äôt have the courage to do so. The politics will soon mandate however because people from California &amp; all over the land are demanding that Sanctuary Cities be GONE. No illegals Drugs or Trafficking!
Thank you @NVGOP! #MAGA

....There is a lot of explaining to do to the millions of people who had just elected a president who they really like and who has done a great job for them with the Military Vets Economy and so much more. This was the illegal and treasonous ‚Äúinsurance policy‚Äù in full action!
In New York State Democrats blocked a Bill expanding College Tuition for Gold Star families after approving aid for illegal immigrants. No wonder so many people are leaving N.Y. Very Sad!
....work that way. I have a better idea. Look at the Obama Book Deal or the ridiculous Netflix deal. Then look at all the deals made by the Dems in Congress the ‚ÄúCongressional Slush Fund‚Äù and lastly the IG Reports. Take a look at them. Those investigations would be over FAST!

I love New York but New York can never be great again under the current leadership of Governor Andrew Cuomo (the brother of Fredo) or Mayor Bill DeBlasio. Cuomo has weaponized the prosecutors to do his dirty work (and to keep him out of jams) a reason some don‚Äôt want to be...

AMERICA IS RESPECTED AGAIN!
Wow. Unbelievable. 
New national Bloomberg poll just released - thank you! Join the MOVEMENT:  #TrumpTrain‚Ä¶ 
Just watched Rep. Eric Swalwell be asked endless softball questions by @marthamaccallum on @FoxNews about the phony Witch Hunt. He was just forced out of the Democrat Presidential Primary because he polled at ZERO. Fox sure ain‚Äôt what it used to be. Too bad!
Senior United States District Judge Robert E. Payne today ruled in favor of Trump campaign delegates who had argued..
Democrats jeopardizing the safety of our troops to bail out their donors from insurance companies. It is time to put #AmericaFirstüá∫üá∏
The Fake News Media has never been so wrong or so dirty. Purposely incorrect stories and phony sources to meet their agenda of hate. Sad!
I was so happy when I heard that @Politico one of the most dishonest political outlets is losing a fortune. Pure scum!

I will be traveling to Florida tomorrow to meet with our great Coast Guard FEMA and many of the brave first responders &amp; others.
Wow! Big pushback on Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York for his really dumb statement about America‚Äôs lack of greatness. I have already MADE America Great Again just look at the markets jobs military- setting records and we will do even better. Andrew ‚Äúchocked‚Äù badly mistake!

Terrible shootings in ElPaso Texas. Reports are very bad many killed. Working with State and Local authorities and Law Enforcement. Spoke to Governor to pledge total support of Federal Government. God be with you all!
Rick Scott is known as easily one of the best Governors in the USA. Florida is setting records in almost every category of success. Amazing achievement-the envy of the World. Ron DeSantis will build on this success. His incompetent opponent will destroy Florida - next Venezuela!
The Fake News Media keeps saying we haven‚Äôt built any NEW WALL. Below is a section just completed on the Border. Anti-climbing feature included. Very high strong and beautiful! Also many miles already renovated and in service! 
The Democrats much as I suspected have allocated no money for a new Wall. So imaginative! The problem is without a Wall there can be no real Border Security - and our Country must finally have a Strong and Secure Southern Border!
Once again someone we were told is ok turns out to be a terrorist who wants to destroy our country &amp; its people- how did he get thru system?
#WheresHillary? Sleeping!!!!!

NO COLLUSION NO OBSTRUCTION NO NOTHING! ‚ÄúWhat the Democrats are trying to do is the biggest sin in the impeachment business.‚Äù David Rivkin Constitutional Scholar. Meantime the Dems are getting nothing done in Congress. They are frozen stiff. Get back to work much to do!
New York get out and VOTE for @JohnFasoNy a great and hardworking Congressman. We need John‚Äôs voice in D.C. His opponent just moved to the area - is Pro-Iran and Anti-Israel. Vote for John. Has my Strong Endorsement!
The Mainstream Media has NEVER been more dishonest than it is now. NBC and MSNBC are going Crazy. They report stories purposely the exact opposite of the facts. They are truly the Opposition Party working with the Dems. May even be worse than Fake News CNN if that is possible!
Together we will prevail in the GREAT state of Texas. We love you!GOD BLESS TEXAS &amp; GOD BLESS THE USAüá∫üá∏ 
Watching @loudobbsnews- fantastic show! Has very interesting take on Paul Ryan.
Mexico will try very hard and if they do that this will be a very successful agreement for both the United States and Mexico!
Great job First Lady Melania! 
The new Fake News narrative is that there is CHAOS in the White House. Wrong! People will always come &amp; go and I want strong dialogue before making a final decision. I still have some people that I want to change (always seeking perfection). There is no Chaos only great Energy!
There will be no amnesty!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #ImWithYou

Network news has become so partisan distorted and fake that licenses must be challenged and if appropriate revoked. Not fair to public!
Of course the Australians have better healthcare than we do --everybody does. ObamaCare is dead! But our healthcare will soon be great.
‚ÄúBiden would be America‚Äôs Dream Candidate because there would be no more Tariffs no more demands that China stop stealing our IP things would go back to the old days with America‚Äôs manufacturers &amp; workers getting shafted. He has Zero Credibility!‚Äù @IngrahamAngle  So true!
Big-game trophy decision will be announced next week but will be very hard pressed to change my mind that this horror show in any way helps conservation of Elephants or any other animal.
Please understand there are consequences when people cross our Border illegally whether they have children or not - and many are just using children for their own sinister purposes. Congress must act on fixing the DUMBEST &amp; WORST immigration laws anywhere in the world! Vote ‚ÄúR‚Äù

ISIS exploded on Hillary Clinton's watch- she's done nothing about it and never will. Not capable!
Now that her claims of being of Indian heritage have turned out to be a scam and a lie Elizabeth Warren should apologize for perpetrating this fraud against the American Public. Harvard called her ‚Äúa person of color‚Äù (amazing con) and would not have taken her otherwise!
You cannot pass legislation on immigration whether it be for safety and security or any other reason including ‚Äúheart‚Äù without getting Dem votes. Problem is they don‚Äôt care about security and R‚Äôs do. Zero Dems voted to support the Goodlatte Bill. They won‚Äôt vote for anything!
Sorry but this is years ago before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren't Crooked Hillary &amp; the Dems the focus?????
At some point the Fake News will be forced to discuss our great jobs numbers strong economy success with ISIS the border &amp; so much else!

So many amazing things happened over the last three days. All or at least most of those things are great for the United States. Much was accomplished!
Why didn‚Äôt President Obama do something about the so-called Russian Meddling when he was told about it by the FBI before the Election? Because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win and he didn‚Äôt want to upset the apple cart! He was in charge not me and did nothing.

Those Tweets were NOT Racist. I don‚Äôt have a Racist bone in my body! The so-called vote to be taken is a Democrat con game. Republicans should not show ‚Äúweakness‚Äù and fall into their trap. This should be a vote on the filthy language statements and lies told by the Democrat.....

Secret Service has just informed me that Senator Jon Tester‚Äôs statements on Admiral Jackson are not true. There were no such findings. A horrible thing that we in D.C. must live with just like phony Russian Collusion. Tester should lose race in Montana. Very dishonest and sick!

The Corrupt Media refuses to cover this! 
....long before they get to our Southern Border. Guatemala is getting ready to sign a Safe-Third Agreement. The only ones who won‚Äôt do anything are the Democrats in Congress. They must vote to get rid of the loopholes and fix asylum! If so Border Crisis will end quickly!
....asking Hillary Clinton why she deleted and acid washed her Emails AFTER getting a subpoena from Congress? Anybody else would be in jail for that yet the Dems refuse to even bring it up. Rigged House Committee
Isn‚Äôt it ironic that large Caravans of people are marching to our border wanting U.S.A. asylum because they are fearful of being in their country - yet they are proudly waving....
....We are substantially subsidizing the Militaries of many VERY rich countries all over the world while at the same time these countries take total advantage of the U.S. and our TAXPAYERS on Trade. General Mattis did not see this as a problem. I DO and it is being fixed!

A vicious accuser of Justice Kavanough has just admitted that she was lying her story was totally made up or FAKE! Can you imagine if he didn‚Äôt become a Justice of the Supreme Court because of her disgusting False Statements. What about the others? Where are the Dems on this?
....looking for trouble. They are enjoying ruining people‚Äôs lives and REFUSE to look at the real corruption on the Democrat side - the lies the firings the deleted Emails and soooo much more! Mueller‚Äôs Angry Dems are looking to impact the election. They are a National Disgrace!
Plagiarism charge against Sleepy Joe Biden on his ridiculous Climate Change Plan is a big problem but the Corrupt Media will save him. His other problem is that he is drawing flies not people to his Rallies. Nobody is showing up I mean nobody. You can‚Äôt win without people!

Sen. Jeff Flake(y) who is unelectable in the Great State of Arizona (quit race anemic polls) was caught (purposely) on ‚Äúmike‚Äù saying bad things about your favorite President. He‚Äôll be a NO on tax cuts because his political career anyway is ‚Äútoast.‚Äù
Hillary Clinton doesn't have the strength or the stamina to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! #AmericaFirst
If we don‚Äôt have a wall system we‚Äôre not going to have a country. Congress must fund the BORDER WALL &amp; prohibit grants to sanctuary jurisdictions that threaten the security of our country &amp; the people of our country. We must enforce our laws &amp; protect our people! #BuildTheWall 
.....and G.M. would not be closing their plants in Ohio Michigan &amp; Maryland. Get smart Congress. Also the countries that send us cars have taken advantage of the U.S. for decades. The President has great power on this issue - Because of the G.M. event it is being studied now!

We gave Nadler and his Trump hating Dems the complete Mueller Report (we didn‚Äôt have to) and even Mueller himself but now that both were a total BUST they say it wasn‚Äôt good enough. Nothing will ever be good enough for them. Witch Hunt!

Victory press conference was over. Why is she allowed to grab me and shout questions? Can I press charges?

The migrant ‚Äòcaravan‚Äô that is openly defying our border shows how weak &amp; ineffective U.S. immigration laws are. Yet Democrats like Jon Tester continue to support the open borders agenda ‚Äì Tester even voted to protect Sanctuary Cities. We need lawmakers who will put America First.
Good news out of the House with the passing of 'No Sanctuary for Criminals Act.' Hopefully Senate will follow.
Congratulations to our new CIA Director Gina Haspel!

Just like the NFL whose ratings have gone WAY DOWN Nike is getting absolutely killed with anger and boycotts. I wonder if they had any idea that it would be this way? As far as the NFL is concerned I just find it hard to watch and always will until they stand for the FLAG!
Because of the faulty thought process we have going for us at the Federal Reserve we pay much higher interest rates than countries that are no match for us economically. In other words our interest costs are much higher than other countries when they should be lower. Correct!

Hard to believe that with the Crisis on the Border the Dems won‚Äôt do the quick and easy fix. Would solve the problem but they want Open Borders which equals crime!
So funny! I just checked out Fake News CNN for the first time in a long time (they are dying in the ratings) to see if they covered my takedown yesterday of Jim Acosta (actually a nice guy). They didn‚Äôt! But they did say I already lost in my meeting with Putin. Fake News......

Crooked Hillary says we must call on Saudi Arabia and other countries to stop funding hate. I am calling on- cont'd: 
Greatly dishonest of @TedCruz to file a financial disclosure form &amp; not list his lending banks- then pretend he is going to clean up Wall St
Very productive talks yesterday with China on Trade. Will continue today! I will be leaving for Hanoi Vietnam early tomorrow for a Summit with Kim Jong Un of North Korea where we both expect a continuation of the progress made at first Summit in Singapore. Denuclearization?

The failing @NYTimes would do much better if they were honest! 
In order to #DrainTheSwamp &amp; create a new GOVERNMENT of by &amp; for the PEOPLE I need your VOTE! Go to  LET'S #MAGA!
If their highly unethical behavior including begging me for ads isn‚Äôt questionable enough they have endorsed a candidate who can‚Äôt win.
....In addition I want to meet not only my accuser who presented SECOND &amp; THIRD HAND INFORMATION but also the person who illegally gave this information which was largely incorrect to the ‚ÄúWhistleblower.‚Äù Was this person SPYING on the U.S. President? Big Consequences!
Nolte: Poll Shows Media Failed to Gaslight Public About Trump Campaign Spying  via @BreitbartNews
With only a very small majority the Republicans in the House &amp; Senate need more victories next year since Dems totally obstruct no votes!
China is actually placing propaganda ads in the Des Moines Register and other papers made to look like news. That‚Äôs because we are beating them on Trade opening markets and the farmers will make a fortune when this is over! 
Tariffs are the greatest! Either a country which has treated the United States unfairly on Trade negotiates a fair deal or it gets hit with Tariffs. It‚Äôs as simple as that - and everybody‚Äôs talking! Remember we are the ‚Äúpiggy bank‚Äù that‚Äôs being robbed. All will be Great!
Once again we will have a government of by and for the people. Join the MOVEMENT today!  
‚ÄúTrump just took a giant step towards actual welfare reform‚Äù 
Great afternoon in Ohio &amp; a great evening in Pennsylvania - departing now. See you tomorrow Virginia! 
Military solutions are now fully in placelocked and loadedshould North Korea act unwisely.  Hopefully Kim Jong Un will find another path!
Congrats to the House for passing the VA MISSION Act yesterday. Without this funding our veterans will be forced to stand in never ending lines in order to receive care. Putting politics over our veterans care is UNACCEPTABLE ‚Äì Senate must vote yes on this bill by Memorial Day!
It was the childishly written &amp; taunting PR statement by Fox that made me not do the debate more so than lightweight reporter @megynkelly.
If President Obama (who got nowhere with North Korea and would have had to go to war with many millions of people being killed) had gotten along with North Korea and made the initial steps toward a deal that I have the Fake News would have named him a national hero!
Thank you Governor Phil Bryant - it was my great honor to be there! #MAGA 
It was a really great day for America! A special evening tonight on @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity  &amp; @IngrahamAngle Will be very interesting!
Thank you Georgia! I had a great afternoon with all of you! I will be back soon. #MakeAmerciaGreatAgain 
Just heard the Campaign was sued by the Obstructionist Democrats. This can be good news in that we will now counter for the DNC Server that they refused to give to the FBI the Wendy Wasserman Schultz Servers and Documents held by the Pakistani mystery man and Clinton Emails.

Very interesting election currently taking place in France.
Doing great with China and other Trade Deals. The only problem we have is Jay Powell and the Fed. He‚Äôs like a golfer who can‚Äôt putt has no touch. Big U.S. growth if he does the right thing BIG CUT - but don‚Äôt count on him! So far he has called it wrong and only let us down....
Heading to California with @GOPLeader Kevin McCarthy @RepLaMalfa and @KenCalvert. Look forward to being with our brave Firefighters First Responders and @FEMA along with the many brave People of California. We are with you all the way ‚Äì God Bless you all!

Great Twitter poll- and I wasn't even there. Thank you! #GOPDebate 
I am in the process of interviewing some really great people for the position of White House Chief of Staff. Fake News has been saying with certainty it was Nick Ayers a spectacular person who will always be with our #MAGA agenda. I will be making a decision soon!
Luther Strange has been shooting up in the Alabama polls since my endorsement. Finish the job - vote today for "Big Luther."
So important. Should have been done years ago! 
Great op-ed from @RepKenBuck. Looks like some in the Freedom Caucus are helping me end #Obamacare. 
FEMA First Responders and Law Enforcement are working really hard on hurricane Florence. As the storm begins to finally recede they will kick into an even higher gear. Very Professional!


Wow @CNN RATINGS HAVE CRASHED. LOST ALL CREDIBILITY!
The State of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated- a total fraud!
....guilty even on a civil basis. Those charges were just agreed to by him in order to embarrass the president and get a much reduced prison sentence which he did-including the fact that his family was temporarily let off the hook. As a lawyer Michael has great liability to me!
‚ÄúGo across the world and you‚Äôll see either very low interest rates or negative rates. The President wants to be competitive with these other countries on this but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll fire Jay Powell (even if I should!).‚Äù We should always be paying less interest than others!
Great bilateral meetings at √âlys√©e Palace w/ President @EmmanuelMacron. The friendship between our two nations and ourselves is unbreakable. 
Crooked Hillary Clintons foreign interventions unleashed ISIS in Syria Iraq and Libya. She is reckless and dangerous!
Word is-early voting in FL is very dishonest. Little Marco his State Chairman &amp; their minions are working overtime-trying to rig the vote.
Happy Constitution Day! 
Thank you David! 

Turkey has taken advantage of the United States for many years. They are now holding our wonderful Christian Pastor who I must now ask to represent our Country as a great patriot hostage. We will pay nothing for the release of an innocent man but we are cutting back on Turkey!

My Administration looks forward to negotiating a large scale Trade Deal with the United Kingdom. The potential is unlimited!
Mexico is doing great at the Border but China is letting us down in that they have not been buying the agricultural products from our great Farmers that they said they would. Hopefully they will start soon!
A great guy (with great ratings)! 
Dan will be GREAT! 
Happy Easter! I have never been happier or more content because your Country is doing so well with an Economy that is the talk of the World and may be stronger than it has ever been before. Have a great day!
So much happening with the now discredited Witch Hunt. This total Hoax will be studied for years!
It is expected that China will be buying large amounts of our agricultural products!
‚ÄúWe absolutely need a physical barrier or Wall whatever you want to call it. The President yesterday laid all that out. We need to do it all including the Wall. I provided the same information to the previous administration &amp; it was ignored.‚Äù Mark Morgan Border Chief for ‚ÄúO‚Äù!

Joe Ricketts one of our Country‚Äôs most successful businessmen including being the owner of the Chicago Cubs has just written a great new book THE HARDER YOU WORK THE LUCKIER YOU GET. So true! Much can be learned from Joe. Go get the book!

Michael Isikoff was the first to report Dossier allegations and now seriously doubts the Dossier claims. The whole Russian Collusion thing was a HOAX but who is going to restore the good name of so many people whose reputations have been destroyed?
HAPPY NEW YEAR! 
The Washington Post said I refer to Jeff Sessions as ‚ÄúMr. Magoo‚Äù and Rod Rosenstein as ‚ÄúMr. Peepers.‚Äù This is ‚Äúaccording to people with whom the president has spoken.‚Äù There are no such people and don‚Äôt know these characters...just more Fake &amp; Disgusting News to create ill will!
My thoughts and prayers are with the families of our serviceman who was killed and his fellow servicemen who were wounded in Somolia. They are truly all HEROES.
Unbelievable support in Florida last night - thank you! #MAGA 
Last night it was my great honor to host America‚Äôs senior defense and military leaders for dinner at the White House. America‚Äôs military is the GREATEST fighting force in the history of the world. They all have my pledge of unwavering commitment to our men and women in uniform! 
When people come into our Country illegally they will be DEPORTED!
Our Country has lost stupidly Trillions of Dollars with China over many years. They have stolen our Intellectual Property at a rate of Hundreds of Billions of Dollars a year &amp; they want to continue. I won‚Äôt let that happen! We don‚Äôt need China and frankly would be far....
Hard to believe that the Democrats who have gone so far LEFT that they are no longer recognizable are fighting so hard for Sanctuary crime

The story in the New York Times regarding Jim Webb being considered as the next Secretary of Defense is FAKE NEWS. I‚Äôm sure he is a fine man but I don‚Äôt know Jim and never met him. Patrick Shanahan who is Acting Secretary of Defense is doing a great job!
My thoughts and prayers are with Pastor Brunson and we hope to have him safely back home soon!
FEMA and first responders are working hard (yet again) on Hurricane Nate. Military helping. Very much under control!
Melania and I were treated very nicely yesterday in Pittsburgh. The Office of the President was shown great respect on a very sad &amp; solemn day. We were treated so warmly. Small protest was not seen by us staged far away. The Fake News stories were just the opposite-Disgraceful! 
The Navy put out a disclaimer on the McCain story. Looks like the story was an exaggeration or even Fake News - but why not everything else is!

Robert Mueller is being asked to testify yet again. He said he could only stick to the Report &amp; that is what he would and must do. After so much testimony &amp; total transparency this Witch Hunt must now end. No more Do Overs. No Collusion No Obstruction. The Great Hoax is dead!
Everyone in the path of #Gordon please heed the advice of State and local officials and follow @NHC_Atlantic for updates. The Federal Government stands ready to assist. Be safe! 
....They call it ‚Äúserving at the pleasure of the President.‚Äù The U.S. now has a very strong and powerful foreign policy much different than proceeding administrations. It is called quite simply America First! With all of that however I have done FAR more for Ukraine than O.
The Dems are getting another beauty to join their group. Bill de Blasio of NYC considered the worst mayor in the U.S. will supposedly be making an announcement for president today. He is a JOKE but if you like high taxes &amp; crime he‚Äôs your man. NYC HATES HIM!
Great Republican vote today on Disaster Relief Bill. We will now work out a bipartisan solution that gets relief for our great States and Farmers. Thank you to all. Get me a Bill that I can quickly sign!

Impossible to believe that @FoxNews has hired @donnabrazile the person fired by @CNN (after they tried to hide the bad facts &amp; failed) for giving Crooked Hillary Clinton the questions to a debate something unimaginable. Now she is all over Fox including Shep Smith by far....
John James running as a Republican for the Senate from Michigan is a spectacular young star of the future. We should make him a star of the present. A distinguished West Point Grad and Vet people should Vote Out Schumer Puppet Debbie Stabenow who does nothing for Michigan!
The U.S. economy is looking very good in my opinion even better than anticipated. Companies are pouring back into our country reversing the long term trend of leaving. The unemployment numbers are looking great and Regulations &amp; Taxes have been massively Cut! JOBS JOBS JOBS
....Does anybody think this is fair? Even though there was no quid pro quo I‚Äôm sure they would like to try. Worse than the Dems!
Thank you our great honor!

So it was indeed (just proven in court papers) ‚Äúlast in his class‚Äù (Annapolis) John McCain that sent the Fake Dossier to the FBI and Media hoping to have it printed BEFORE the Election. He &amp; the Dems working together failed (as usual). Even the Fake News refused this garbage!

Countries are coming to us wanting to negotiate REAL trade deals not the one sided horror show deals made by past administrations. They don‚Äôt want to be targeted for Tariffs by the U.S.
The recent Kansas election (Congress) was a really big media event until the Republicans won. Now they play the same game with Georgia-BAD!
It is my opinion that many of the leaks coming out of the White House are fabricated lies made up by the #FakeNews media.

Why didn‚Äôt President Obama do something about Russia in September (before November Election) when told by the FBI? He did NOTHING and had no intention of doing anything!

Another activist Obama appointed judge has just ruled against us on a section of the Southern Wall that is already under construction. This is a ruling against Border Security and in favor of crime drugs and human trafficking. We are asking for an expedited appeal!
Joe Biden just said ‚ÄúWe believe in facts not truth.‚Äù Does anybody really believe he is mentally fit to be president? We are ‚Äúplaying‚Äù in a very big and complicated world. Joe doesn‚Äôt have a clue!
‚ÄúThree more Central Banks cut rates.‚Äù Our problem is not China - We are stronger than ever money is pouring into the U.S. while China is losing companies by the thousands to other countries and their currency is under siege - Our problem is a Federal Reserve that is too.....

An honor to meet with the Polish American Congress in Chicago this morning! #ImWithYou Video:‚Ä¶ 
Shifty Adam Schiff wants to rest his entire case on a Whistleblower who he now says can‚Äôt testify &amp; the reason he can‚Äôt testify is that he is afraid to do so because his account of the Presidential telephone call is a fraud &amp; totally different from the actual transcribed call...
While I very much appreciate P.M. Abe going to Iran to meet with Ayatollah Ali Khamenei I personally feel that it is too soon to even think about making a deal. They are not ready and neither are we!
Early on Ted Cruz said that if he didn't win South Carolina it's over. He didn't win- and lost to me in a landslide!
ObamaCare is in serious trouble. The Dems need big money to keep it going - otherwise it dies far sooner than anyone would have thought.
The real story on Collusion is in Donna B's new book. Crooked Hillary bought the DNC &amp; then stole the Democratic Primary from Crazy Bernie!
Melania and I were thrilled to join the dedicated men and women of the @USEmbassyFrance members of the U.S. Military and their families. 
Senator Bob Corker just stated that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so priveledged to serve in the Senate for twelve years and that‚Äôs what I told the people of our state that‚Äôs what I‚Äôd do serve for two terms.‚Äù But that is Not True - wanted to run but poll numbers TANKED when I wouldn‚Äôt endorse him.....
Congratulations to Doug Jones on a hard fought victory. The write-in votes played a very big factor but a win is a win. The people of Alabama are great and the Republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time. It never ends!
Well now that collusion with Russia is proving to be a total hoax and the only collusion is with Hillary Clinton and the FBI/Russia the Fake News Media (Mainstream) and this phony new book are hitting out at every new front imaginable. They should try winning an election. Sad!
Tremendous pressure is building like never before for the Border Wall and an end to crime cradling Sanctuary Cities. Started the Wall in San Diego where the people were pushing really hard to get it. They will soon be protected!
Chairman Kim realizes perhaps better than anyone else that without nuclear weapons his country could fast become one of the great economic powers anywhere in the World. Because of its location and people (and him) it has more potential for rapid growth than any other nation!
Thank you Jim! 
....proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone. I am in no hurry our Military is rebuilt new  and ready to go by far the best in the world. Sanctions are biting &amp; more added last night. Iran can NEVER have Nuclear Weapons not against the USA and not against the WORLD!
Just signed Disaster Aid Bill to help Americans who have been hit by recent catastrophic storms. So important for our GREAT American farmers and ranchers. Help for GA FL IA NE NC and CA. Puerto Rico should love President Trump. Without me they would have been shut out! 
Goofy Elizabeth Warren and her phony Native American heritage are on a Twitter rant. She is too easy! I'm driving her nuts.
Everybody wants to keep their Security Clearance it‚Äôs worth great prestige and big dollars even board seats and that is why certain people are coming forward to protect Brennan. It certainly isn‚Äôt because of the good job he did! He is a political ‚Äúhack.‚Äù
Just another disgruntled former employee who got fired for gross incompetence! 
‚ÄúLanny Davis admits being anonymous source in CNN Report.‚Äù @BretBaier  Oh well so much for CNN saying it wasn‚Äôt Lanny. No wonder their ratings are so low it‚Äôs FAKE NEWS!
Goofy Elizabeth Warren is weak and ineffective. Does nothing. All talk no action -- maybe her Native American name?
The Justice Dept. should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court - &amp; seek much tougher version!
Thoughts &amp; prayers are w/ our @USNavy sailors aboard the #USSJohnSMcCain where search &amp; rescue efforts are underway.

Secretary of the Interior @RyanZinke will be leaving the Administration at the end of the year after having served for a period of almost two years. Ryan has accomplished much during his tenure and I want to thank him for his service to our Nation.......
The Democrats are so focused on hurting the Republican Party and the President that they are unable to get anything done because of it including legislation on gun safety lowering of prescription drug prices infrastructure etc. So bad for our Country!
Our hearts &amp; prayers go out to the people of London who suffered a vicious terrorist attack.... 
I have great confidence that China will properly deal with North Korea. If they are unable to do so the U.S. with its allies will! U.S.A.
I have just ordered Homeland Security to step up our already Extreme Vetting Program. Being politically correct is fine but not for this!
It is now commonly agreed after many months of COSTLY looking that there was NO collusion between Russia and Trump. Was collusion with HC!

‚ÄúThe President is the biggest and best supporter of the Steel Industry in many years. We are now doing really well. The Tariffs let us compete. Was unfair that the Steel Industry lost its jobs to unfair trade laws. Very positive outcome.‚Äù Mark Glyptis United Steelworkers
Stock Market hit all time high on Friday. Congratulations U.S.A.!
The Tax Cuts are so large and so meaningful and yet the Fake News is working overtime to follow the lead of their friends the defeated Dems and only demean. This is truly a case where the results will speak for themselves starting very soon. Jobs Jobs Jobs!

Our infrastructure plan has been put forward and has received great reviews by everyone except of course the Democrats. After many years we have taken care of our Military now we have to fix our roads bridges tunnels airports and more. Bipartisan make deal Dems?
Corrupt Congressman Adam Schiff is angry that Ambassadors that he thought would be good for his fraudulent Witch Hunt are turning out to be good for me - some really good! He‚Äôs got all meetings locked down no transparency only his illegal leaks. A very dishonest sleazebag!
As usual China said they were going to be buying ‚Äúbig‚Äù from our great American Farmers. So far they have not done what they said. Maybe this will be different!
Pastor Andrew Brunson a fine gentleman and Christian leader in the United States is on trial and being persecuted in Turkey for no reason. They call him a Spy but I am more a Spy than he is. Hopefully he will be allowed to come home to his beautiful family where he belongs!
The Democrats will make a deal with me on healthcare as soon as ObamaCare folds - not long. Do not worry we are in very  good shape!
The New York Times is at its lowest point in its long and storied history. Not only is it losing a lot of money but it is a journalistic disaster being laughed at even in the most liberal of enclaves. It has become a very sad joke all all over the World. Witch Hunt hurt them...
Jake Tapper of Fake News CNN just got destroyed in his interview with Stephen Miller of the Trump Administration. Watch the hatred and unfairness of this CNN flunky!

The Fake News gets crazier and more dishonest every single day. Amazing to watch as certain people covering me and the tremendous success of this administration have truly gone MAD! Their Fake reporting creates anger and disunity. Take two weeks off and come back rested. Chill!
The Radical Left Dems went after me for using the words ‚Äúdrug-infested‚Äù concerning Baltimore. Take a look at Elijah C. 

Heading now to the Great State of Alabama!
.....This was done by the Democrats in order to make me look as bad as possible when I was successfully raising Billions of Dollars to help rebuild Puerto Rico. If a person died for any reason like old age just add them onto the list. Bad politics. I love Puerto Rico!
My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!

Saudi Arabia oil supply was attacked. There is reason to believe that we know the culprit are locked and loaded depending on verification but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack and under what terms we would proceed!

#PeaceOfficersMemorialDay and#PoliceWeek Proclamation:  
For many years China (and many other countries) has been taking advantage of the United States on Trade Intellectual Property Theft and much more. Our Country has been losing HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year to China with no end in sight....

I look forward to speaking with Prime Minister Modi about the fact that India for years having put very high Tariffs against the United States just recently increased the Tariffs even further. This is unacceptable and the Tariffs must be withdrawn!
Congratulations America we are now into the second year of the greatest Witch Hunt in American History...and there is still No Collusion and No Obstruction. The only Collusion was that done by Democrats who were unable to win an Election despite the spending of far more money!

Ted is the ultimate hypocrite. Says one thing for money does another for votes. 
China must continue to be strong &amp; tight on the Border of North Korea until a deal is made. The word is that recently the Border has become much more porous and more has been filtering in. I want this to happen and North Korea to be VERY successful but only after signing!

I explained to the President of China that a trade deal with the U.S. will be far better for them if they solve the North Korean problem!
I often said during rallies with little variation that ‚ÄúMexico will pay for the Wall.‚Äù We have just signed a great new Trade Deal with Mexico. It is Billions of Dollars a year better than the very bad NAFTA deal which it replaces. The difference pays for Wall many times over!
Pocahontas just stated that the Democrats lead by the legendary Crooked Hillary Clinton rigged the Primaries! Lets go FBI &amp; Justice Dept.
Crooked Hillary should try it again!

There is no political necessity to keep Canada in the new NAFTA deal. If we don‚Äôt make a fair deal for the U.S. after decades of abuse Canada will be out. Congress should not interfere w/ these negotiations or I will simply terminate NAFTA entirely &amp; we will be far better off...

While the Republicans and Democrats in Congress are working hard to come up with a solution to DACA they should be strongly considering a system of Merit Based Immigration so that we will have the people ready willing and able to help all of those companies moving into the USA!
It is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and I can now fight for America the way I want to.
I am on @foxandfriends - Enjoy!

The Whistleblower got it sooo wrong that HE must come forward. The Fake News Media knows who he is but being an arm of the Democrat Party don‚Äôt want to reveal him because there would be hell to pay.  Reveal the Whistleblower and end the Impeachment Hoax!
China Iran &amp; other foreign countries are looking at the Democrat Candidates and ‚Äúdrooling‚Äù over the small prospect that they could be dealing with them in the not too distant future. They would be able to rip off our beloved USA like never before. With President Trump NO WAY!

The Democrats who know Steel Slats (Wall) are necessary for Border Security are putting politics over Country. What they are just beginning to realize is that I will not sign any of their legislation including infrastructure unless it has perfect Border Security. U.S.A. WINS!
‚ÄúMy view is that not only has Trump been vindicated in the last several weeks about the mishandling of the Dossier and the lies about the Clinton/DNC Dossier it shows that he‚Äôs been victimized. He‚Äôs been victimized by the Obama Administration who were using all sorts of.......

The Fake News is not mentioning the safety and security of our Country when talking about illegal immigration. Our immigration laws are the weakest and worst anywhere in the world and the Dems will do anything not to change them &amp; to obstruct-want open borders which means crime!

Lightweight Marco Rubio was working hard last night. The problem is he is a choker and once a choker always a choker! Mr. Meltdown.
So now it is reported that the Democrats who have excoriated Carter Page about Russia don't want him to testify. He blows away their....
Border Patrol Agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the Border because of ridiculous liberal (Democrat) laws like Catch &amp; Release. Getting more dangerous. ‚ÄúCaravans‚Äù coming. Republicans must go to Nuclear Option to pass tough laws NOW. NO MORE DACA DEAL!
The MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN agenda is doing very well despite the distraction of the Witch Hunt. Many new jobs high business enthusiasm..
In our Country so much money has been poured down the drain for so many years but when it comes to Border Security and the Military the Democrats fight to the death. We won on the Military which is being completely rebuilt. One way or the other we will win on the Wall!
The Federal Reserve is derelict in its duties if it doesn‚Äôt lower the Rate and even ideally stimulate. Take a look around the World at our competitors. Germany and others are  actually GETTING PAID to borrow money. Fed was way too fast to raise and way too slow to cut!
Bad lawyer and fraudster Michael Cohen said under sworn testimony that he never asked for a Pardon. His lawyers totally contradicted him. He lied! Additionally he directly asked me for a pardon. I said NO. He lied again! He also badly wanted to work at the White House. He lied!
The Failing New York Times stated in an article written by Obama flunky Peter Baker (who lovingly wrote Obama book)‚ÄùEven after the President forecast the storm to include Alabama.‚Äù THIS IS NOT TRUE. I said VERY EARLY ON that it MAY EVEN hit Alabama. A BIG DIFFERENCE.....

This is the Cruz voter violation certificate sent to everyone a misdemeanor at minimum.

Every time you see a Caravan or people illegally coming or attempting to come into our Country illegally think of and blame the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic Immigration Laws! Remember the Midterms! So unfair to those who come in legally.
I see Schumer is already criticizing my State of the Union speech even though he hasn‚Äôt seen it yet. He‚Äôs just upset that he didn‚Äôt win the Senate after spending a fortune like he thought he would. Too bad we weren‚Äôt given more credit for the Senate win by the media!
What is Frank VanderSloot getting for agreeing to back Marco Rubio? Last victim was Mitt Romney - see how that turned out.

Turkey fully understands not to fire on the Kurds as they leave what will be known as the Safe Zone for other fairly nearby areas. I don‚Äôt have to repeat that large scale Sanctions will be imposed for violations. Going well! ISIS secured by Kurds with Turkey ready as backup.....

Nancy Pelosi today on @GMA actually said that Adam Schiffty Schiff didn‚Äôt fabricate my words in a major speech before Congress. She either had no idea what she was saying in other words lost it or she lied. Even Clinton lover @GStephanopoulos strongly called her out. Sue her?
Republicans must make the horrendous weak and outdated immigration laws and the Border a part of the Midterms!
So many positive things going on for the U.S.A. and the Fake News Media just doesn‚Äôt want to go there. Same negative stories over and over again! No wonder the People no longer trust the media whose approval ratings are correctly at their lowest levels in history!    #MAGA

Crazy Bernie Sanders recently equated the City of Baltimore to a THIRD WORLD COUNTRY! Based on that statement I assume that Bernie must now be labeled a Racist just as a Republican would if he used that term and standard! The fact is Baltimore can be brought back maybe......

...money to Bill the Hillary Russian "reset" praise of Russia by Hillary or Podesta Russian Company. Trump Russia story is a hoax. #MAGA!
.@scottienhughes - you were fantastic on CNN. Thank you for the nice words. See you at the #GOPDebate.
Is President Obama going to finally mention the words radical Islamic terrorism? If he doesn't he should immediately resign in disgrace!
Watching Hurricane closely. My team which has done and is doing such a good job in Texas is already in Florida. No rest for the weary!
.@JimRenacci has worked so hard on Tax Reductions Illegal Immigration the Border and Crime. I need Jim very badly to help our agenda and to keep MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! He will be a fantastic Senator for the Great State of Ohio and has my full endorsement!
.@SteveHiltonx  ‚ÄúThis is President Trump trying to deliver on his promises while the bureaucratic machine fights his agenda. He needs populist allies. These changes are not chaos but rather progress. All this is President Trump at his absolute best.‚Äù Thank you Steve!
So weird to watch Crazy Bernie on @FoxNews. Not surprisingly @BretBaier and the ‚Äúaudience‚Äù was so smiley and nice. Very strange and now we have @donnabrazile?
Proud of our great First Lady - and she loves doing this! 
Thank you Eric! 
It is my great honor to be with so many brilliant courageous patriotic and PROUD AMERICANS. Seeing all of you here today fills me with extraordinary confidence in America‚Äôs future. Each of you is taking part in the Young Black Leadership Summit because you are true leaders... 
....lawyer or law firm will take months to get up to speed (if for no other reason than they can bill more) which is unfair to our great country - and I am very happy with my existing team. Besides there was NO COLLUSION with Russia except by Crooked Hillary and the Dems!
....agricultural products from our Great Farmers in larger amounts than China ever did and ship it to poor &amp; starving countries in the form of humanitarian assistance. In the meantime we will continue to negotiate with China in the hopes that they do not again try to redo deal!
A great and important day at the United Nations.Met with leaders of many nations who agree with much (or all) of what I stated in my speech!
‚ÄúTo this point President Trump‚Äôs achievements are unprecedented.‚Äù  @LouDobbs
The brand new manuscript for a new book by failed lawyer Michael Cohen shows his testimony was a total lie! Pundits should only use it.
The Pittsburgh Post Gazette just endorsed Rick Saccone for Congress. He will be much better for steel and business. Very strong on experience and what our Country needs. Lamb will always vote for Pelosi and Dems....Will raise taxes weak on Crime and Border.
America is OPEN FOR BUSINESS and U.S. Steel is back! 
This is the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history!
....are all coming back to the U.S. So is everyone else. We now have the best Economy in the World the envy of all. Get that big beautiful plant in Ohio open now. Close a plant in China or Mexico where you invested so heavily pre-Trump but not in the U.S.A. Bring jobs home!
PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!
President Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the U.S. China and Russia. Very insulting but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO which the U.S. subsidizes greatly!
.....nice call with with the new President of Ukraine it could not have been better or more honorable and the Fake News Media and Democrats working as a team have fraudulently made it look bad. It wasn‚Äôt bad it was very legal and very good. A continuing Witch Hunt!
If ObamaCare is hurting people &amp; it is why shouldn't it hurt the insurance companies &amp; why should Congress not be paying what public pays?
How do you impeach a Republican President for a crime that was committed by the Democrats? WITCH-HUNT!
John Kasich despite being Governor of Ohio is losing to me in the Ohio polls. Pathetic!
Crooked took MILLIONS from oppressive ME countries. Will she give the $$$ back? Probably not. Don't forget her slog‚Ä¶ 
CNN and others in the Fake News Business keep purposely and inaccurately reporting that I said the ‚ÄúMedia is the Enemy of the People.‚Äù Wrong! I said that the ‚ÄúFake News (Media) is the Enemy of the People‚Äù a very big difference. When you give out false information - not good!
Despite the Phony Witch Hunt we will continue to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Thank you!! 
....to President of the United States (on my first try). I think that would qualify as not smart but genius....and a very stable genius at that!
....came to the campaign. Few people knew the young low level volunteer named George who has already proven to be a liar. Check the DEMS!
The Amazon Washington Post and three lowlife reporters Matt Zapotosky Josh Dawsey and Carol Leonnig wrote another Fake News story without any sources (pure fiction) about Bill Barr &amp; myself. We both deny this story which they knew before they wrote it. A garbage newspaper!
Thank you to Brandon Judd of the National Border Patrol Council for his strong statement on @foxandfriends that we very badly NEED THE WALL. Must also end loophole of ‚Äúcatch &amp; release‚Äù and clean up the legal and other procedures at the border NOW for Safety &amp; Security reasons.

Good luck Vince this will be great! 
That is true and the USA is Winning Again! 

Sebastian Gorka a very talented man who I got to know well while he was working at the White House has just written an excellent book ‚ÄúWhy We Fight.‚Äù Much will be learned from this very good read!
‚ÄúWhat is happening to President Trump with Impeachment is a Constitutional Travesty.‚Äù @GrahamLedger  The likes of which we have never seen before. It is Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi who should be impeached for fraud!

Those that worked with me in this incredible Midterm Election embracing certain policies and principles did very well. Those that did not say goodbye! Yesterday was such a very Big Win and all under the pressure of a Nasty and Hostile Media!
.....remain in the FBI while he himself was being investigated. This is a real issue. It won‚Äôt go into a Mueller Report because Mueller is going to protect these guys. Mueller has an interest in creating the illusion of objectivity around his investigation.‚Äù ALAN DERSHOWITZ....
House Democrats want a SHUTDOWN for the holidays in order to distract from the very popular just passed Tax Cuts. House Republicans don‚Äôt let this happen. Pass the C.R. TODAY and keep our Government OPEN!
Today it was my great honor to present the #MedalOfHonor to @USNavy (SEAL) Master Chief Special Warfare Operator Britt Slabinski in the East Room of the @WhiteHouse. Full ceremony:  
The Radical Left Democrats will never be satisfied with anything we give them. They will always Resist and Obstruct!
Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn. Will be interesting to see what he has to say despite tremendous pressure being put on him about Russian Collusion in our great and obviously highly successful political campaign. There was no Collusion!
The Fake News Is going all out in order to demean and denigrate! Such hatred!
Congratulations to Ron DeSantis on becoming the new Governor of Florida. Against all odds he fought &amp; fought &amp; fought the result being a historic victory. He never gave up and never will. He will be a great Governor!
....Mainstream Media which has lost all credibility has either officially or unofficially become a part of the Radical Left Democrat Party. It is a sick partnership so pathetic to watch! They even covered a tiny staged crowd as they greeted Foul Mouthed Omar in Minnesota a...
Mike Pompeo met with Kim Jong Un in North Korea last week. Meeting went very smoothly and a good relationship was formed. Details of Summit are being worked out now. Denuclearization will be a great thing for World but also for North Korea!

Bernie sanders has abandoned his supporters by endorsing pro-war pro-TPP pro-Wall Street Crooked Hillary Clinton.
....statement. Strange that with so many other people hearing or knowing of the perfectly fine and respectful conversation that they would not have also come forward. Do you know the reason why they did not? Because there was nothing said wrong it was pitch perfect!
Congratulations to Republican Debbie Lesko on her big win in the Special Election for Arizona House seat. Debbie will do a Great Job! Press is so silent.
Congress must get together and immediately eliminate the loopholes at the Border! If no action Border or large sections of Border will close. This is a National Emergency!
KEEP AMERICA GREAT! 
Democrats working with Republicans in Congress can fix the Asylum and other loopholes quickly. We have a major National Emergency at our Border. GET IT DONE NOW!
Does anyone notice how the Montana Congressional race was such a big deal to Dems &amp; Fake News until the Republican won? V was poorly covered
Such an important day at the United Nations so much work and so much success and the Democrats purposely had to ruin and demean it with more breaking news Witch Hunt garbage. So bad for our Country!
Thanks to our historic TAX CUTS America is open for business and millions of American workers are seeing more take-home pay through higher wages salaries and bonuses! 
The Media has a big responsibility to life and safety in our Country. Fake News has contributed greatly to the anger and rage that has built up over many years. News coverage has got to start being fair balanced and unbiased or these terrible problems will only get worse!
Today on this ‚ÄúUSMCA Day of Action‚Äù thousands of grassroots supporters are urging Congress to pass the great bipartisan USMCA. USMCA = more JOBS for American workers more economic growth and more OPPORTUNITY for our farmers ranchers and businesses. #USMCAnow 
The inner workings of the Mueller investigation are a total mess. They have found no collusion and have gone absolutely nuts. They are screaming and shouting at people horribly threatening them to come up with the answers they want. They are a disgrace to our Nation and don‚Äôt...
Sadly this kind of stuff even happened to Ronald Reagan. There is nothing nice about it! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 
Thank you Governor @Mike_Pence!Lets MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN with the American people. #AmericaFirst‚Ä¶ 
Looking back on history who was treated worse Alfonse Capone legendary mob boss killer and ‚ÄúPublic Enemy Number One‚Äù or Paul Manafort political operative &amp; Reagan/Dole darling now serving solitary confinement - although convicted of nothing? Where is the Russian Collusion?
The Clinton's are the real predators...
....far safer and much less expensive. Many more cars will be produced under the new and uniform standard meaning significantly more JOBS JOBS JOBS! Automakers should seize this opportunity because without this alternative to California you will be out of business.
As I have long been saying and has now been proven out this is a Witch Hunt against the Republican Party and myself and it was the other side that caused the problem not us!
FLORIDA - It is imperative that you heed the directions of your State and Local Officials. Please be prepared be careful and be SAFE! #HurricaneMichael  
Gina Haspel my highly respected nominee to lead the CIA is being praised for the fact that she has been and alway will be TOUGH ON TERROR! This is a woman who has been a leader wherever she has gone. The CIA wants her to lead them into America‚Äôs  bright and glorious future!
Much of the bad blood with Russia is caused by the Fake &amp; Corrupt Russia Investigation headed up by the all Democrat loyalists or people that worked for Obama. Mueller is most conflicted of all (except Rosenstein who signed FISA &amp; Comey letter). No Collusion so they go crazy!
Just arrived in Cleveland Ohio- join Governor @Mike_Pence and I now LIVE via: 
Virginia with all of the massive amount of defense and other work I brought to you and with everything planned go out and vote Republican today. I know the Dems are saying that they have your vote locked up but that would mean a long slide down. VOTE REPUBLICAN TODAY!
On my way to Pensacola Florida. See everyone soon! #MAGA 
The Ukraine investigation is just as Corrupt and Fake as all of the other garbage that went on before it. Even Shifty Schiff got caught cheating when he made up what I said on the call!

Melania and I extend our deepest condolences to the family of Shimon Peres...
We will follow two simple rules: BUY AMERICAN &amp; HIRE AMERICAN!#InaugurationDay #MAGAüá∫üá∏
There is no amount of testimony or document production that can satisfy Jerry Nadler or Shifty Adam Schiff. It is now time to focus exclusively on properly running our great Country!
‚ÄúThe President has accomplished some absolutely historic things during this past year.‚Äù Thank you Charlie Kirk of Turning Points USA. Sadly the Fake Mainstream Media will NEVER talk about our accomplishments in their end of year reviews. We are compiling a long &amp; beautiful list.
...differences they will be resolved in time by President Trump and China‚Äôs great President Xi Jinping. Their relationship and bond remain very strong.
‚ÄúCongressman Adam Schiff who when seeing the REAL Ukraine phone call Transcript decided he‚Äôd better make up one of his own. ‚ÄòI‚Äôm going to say this only SEVEN times so you better listen good. I want you to MAKE UP DIRT ON MY POLITICAL OPPONENT UNDERSTAND LOTS OF IT AND.....
Wow the Failing @nytimes said about @foxandfriends "....the most powerful T.V. show in America."
The harsh and unfair treatment of Judge Brett Kavanaugh is having an incredible upward impact on voters. The PEOPLE get it far better than the politicians. Most importantly this great life cannot be ruined by mean &amp; despicable Democrats and totally uncorroborated allegations!
Watching Sleepy Joe Biden making a speech. Sooo Boring! The LameStream Media will die in the ratings and clicks with this guy. It will be over for them not to mention the fact that our Country will do poorly with him. It will be one big crash but at least China will be happy!
My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and families of those affected by two powerful earthquakes in Italy and Myanmar.
Heading to Nevada to talk trade and immigration with supporters. Country‚Äôs economy is stronger than ever before with numbers that are getting better by the week. Tremendous potential and trade deals are coming along well.
The W.H. is functioning perfectly focused on HealthCare Tax Cuts/Reform &amp; many other things. I have very little time for watching T.V.
On my way - see you all shortly!  
Brandon Judd of the National Border Patrol Council is right when he says on @foxandfriends that the Democrat inspired laws make it tough for us to stop people at the Border. MUST BE CHANDED but I am bringing out the military for this National Emergency. They will be stopped!

CNN‚Äôs Don Lemon the dumbest man on television insinuated last night while asking a debate ‚Äúquestion‚Äù that I was a racist when in fact I am ‚Äúthe least racist person in the world.‚Äù Perhaps someone should explain to Don that he is supposed to be neutral unbiased &amp; fair.....

Senator @lisamurkowski of the Great State of Alaska really let the Republicans and our country down yesterday. Too bad!
As they have learned in the last two years our great American Farmers know that China will not be able to hurt them in that their President has stood with them and done what no other president would do - And I‚Äôll do it again next year if necessary!
I told you so! The European Union just slapped a Five Billion Dollar fine on one of our great companies Google. They truly have taken advantage of the U.S. but not for long!

The so-called Whistleblower‚Äôs account of my perfect phone call is ‚Äúway off‚Äù not even close. Schiff and Pelosi never thought I would release the transcript of the call. Got them by surprise they got caught. This is a fraud against the American people!

Crazy Bernie has just entered the race. I wish him well!
The House of Representatives seeks contempt citations(?) against the JusticeDepartment and the FBI for withholding key documents and an FBI witness which could shed light on surveillance of associates of Donald Trump. Big stuff. Deep State. Give this information NOW! @FoxNews

The Woodward book has already been refuted and discredited by General (Secretary of Defense) James Mattis and General (Chief of Staff) John Kelly. Their quotes were made up frauds a con on the public. Likewise other stories and quotes. Woodward is a Dem operative? Notice timing?

So nice everyone wants Ivanka Trump to be the new United Nations Ambassador. She would be incredible but I can already hear the chants of Nepotism! We have great people that want the job.
With Caravans marching through Mexico and toward our Country Republicans must be prepared to do whatever is necessary for STRONG Border Security. Dems do nothing. If there is no Wall there is no Security. Human Trafficking Drugs and Criminals of all dimensionns - KEEP OUT!

I was NOT going to fire Bob Mueller and did not fire Bob Mueller. In fact he was allowed to finish his Report with unprecedented help from the Trump Administration. Actually lawyer Don McGahn had a much better chance of being fired than Mueller. Never a big fan!
.@DianeHarkey is an extraordinary woman of great accomplishment &amp; potential. She is running as a very popular Republican for the Congressional seat of my friend Darrell Issa-with his complete support. Diane is strong on crime loves our Military &amp; Vets-has my total Endorsement!

Why isn‚Äôt Congressman Adam Schiff being brought up on charges for fraudulently making up a statement and reading it to Congress as if this statement which was very dishonest and bad for me was directly made by the President of the United States? This should never be allowed!

Thank you! 
Getting ready to leave for the Great State of Texas! #MAGA
....Fake News will be working hard to find them. Great love all around. Also big Trade Deal is possible once U.K. gets rid of the shackles. Already starting to talk!
This is because the Euro and other currencies are devalued against the dollar putting the U.S. at a big disadvantage. The Fed Interest rate way too high added to ridiculous quantitative tightening! They don‚Äôt have a clue!

‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt often I get angry at the dirty politics of the Democrats in Congress but this time I am enraged and hope this impeachment charade will backfire on Reps. Pelosi &amp; Schiff &amp; the Democrats. I have read thoroughly the telephone conversation between Trump &amp; the President...
Employment is up Taxes are DOWN. Enjoy!
This was a great evening- I would like to thank everyone for their wonderful support.
.....But should be much higher than that if Twitter wasn‚Äôt playing their political games. No wonder Congress wants to get involved - and they should. Must be more and fairer companies to get out the WORD!
Dealing with @LindseyGrahamSC and many members of Congress including Democrats about imposing powerful Sanctions on Turkey. Treasury is ready to go additional legislation may be sought. There is great consensus on this. Turkey has asked that it not be done. Stay tuned!
In addition to great incompetence and corruption The Smollett case in Chicago is also about a Hate Crime. Remember ‚ÄúMAGA COUNTRY DID IT!‚Äù That turned out to be a total lie had nothing to do with ‚ÄúMAGA COUNTRY.‚Äù Serious stuff and not even an apology to millions of people!
To those in the Caravan turnaround we are not letting people into the United States illegally. Go back to your Country and if you want apply for citizenship like millions of others are doing!

Our Economy is doing better than ever. Money is pouring into our cherished DOLLAR like rarely before companies earnings are higher than ever inflation is low &amp; business optimism is higher than it has ever been. For the first time in many decades we are protecting our workers!

....non-existent ‚Äúsources‚Äù and a drunk/drugged up loser who hates Michael a fine person with a wonderful family. Michael is a businessman for his own account/lawyer who I have always liked &amp; respected. Most people will flip if the Government lets them out of trouble even if....
Totally clears the President. Thank you!
President Obama should have gone to Louisiana days ago instead of golfing. Too little too late!
So amazing! 
Today I opened a major Apple Manufacturing plant in Texas that will bring high paying jobs back to America. Today Nancy Pelosi closed Congress because she doesn‚Äôt care about American Workers!
We have today informed the countries of Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador that if they allow their citizens or others to journey through their borders and up to the United States with the intention of entering our country illegally all payments made to them will STOP (END)!

Impeachment Witch Hunt is now OVER! Ambassador Sondland asks U.S. President (me): ‚ÄúWhat do you want from Ukraine? I keep hearing all these different ideas &amp; theories. What do you want? It was a very abrupt conversation. He was not in a good mood. He (the President) just said‚Äù...

Just watched Congresswoman Debbie Dingell and many other Democrats wanting to give up on our very successful Trade battle with China which has had its worst Economic year in memory (and getting worse). We are taking in $Billions. Will be big for Farmers and ALL!
Border Security and the Wall ‚Äúthing‚Äù and Shutdown is not where Nancy Pelosi wanted to start her tenure as Speaker! Let‚Äôs make a deal?
Thank you Newt!  
Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone in the path of California‚Äôs wildfires. I encourage everyone to heed the advice and orders of local and state officials. THANK YOU to all First Responders for your incredible work!

Democrats must change the Loophole &amp; Asylum Laws - but they probably won‚Äôt! They want Open Borders which means massive crime and drugs! 
Canada has treated our Agricultural business and Farmers very poorly for a very long period of time. Highly restrictive on Trade! They must open their markets and take down their trade barriers! They report a really high surplus on trade with us. Do Timber &amp; Lumber in U.S.?
Closely monitoring #HurricaneHarvey from Camp David. We are leaving nothing to chance. City State and Federal Govs. working great together!

Today we commit to fighting the drug epidemic together! #UNGA 
Despite the phony Witch Hunt going on in America the economic &amp; jobs numbers are great. Regulations way down jobs and enthusiasm way up!
With that being said I have personally directed the fix to the unmasking process since taking office and today‚Äôs vote is about foreign surveillance of foreign bad guys on foreign land. We need it! Get smart!
China which is a great economic power is considered a Developing Nation within the World Trade Organization. They therefore get tremendous perks and advantages especially over the U.S. Does anybody think this is fair. We were badly represented. The WTO is unfair to U.S.
Kimberley Strassel should get the Pulitzer. She is a treasure (and I don‚Äôt know her) who correctly called the Russia Hoax right from the start! Others who were soooo wrong will get the Prize. Fake News!

When all of the people pushing so hard for Criminal Justice Reform were  unable to come even close to getting it done they came to me as a group and asked for my help. I got it done with a group of Senators &amp; others who would never have gone for it. Obama couldn‚Äôt come close....
Working hard thank you! 
I just watched a Fake reporter from the Amazon Washington Post say the White House is ‚Äúchaotic there does not seem to be a strategy for this Shutdown. There is no plan.‚Äù The Fakes always like talking Chaos there is NONE. In fact there‚Äôs almost nobody in the W.H. but me and...

CLINTON CORRUPTION AND HER SABOTAGE OF THE INNER CITIES. Full speech transcript: 
Median household income is down for the middle class since Obama took office. It will only go further down under Clinton.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
My deepest sympathies to the families and friends of those involved in the terrible boat accident which just took place in Missouri. Such a tragedy such a great loss. May God be with you all!
Great interview by @LouDobbs with Chris Farrell of Judicial Watch concerning the governments counter-intelligence operation into the Trump Campaign. SPYGATE at the highest level. Who would believe?
It is Clinton and Sanders people who disrupted my rally in Chicago - and then they say I must talk to my people. Phony politicians!
Our hearts are with all affected by the wildfires in California. God bless our brave First Responders and @FEMA team. We support you! 
If Elizabeth Warren often referred to by me as Pocahontas did this commercial from Bighorn or Wounded Knee instead of her kitchen with her husband dressed in full Indian garb it would have been a smash! 
Today it was an honor to have @UNSecretary-General @AntonioGuterres at the @WhiteHouse. Speaking for the U.S.A. we appreciate all you do! 
Despite requests I have no plans to meet Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. Maybe someday in the future. I am sure he is an absolutely lovely man!
The hatred and extreme bias of me by @CNN has clouded their thinking and made them unable to function. But actually as I have always said this has been going on for a long time. Little Jeff Z has done a terrible job his ratings suck &amp; AT&amp;T should fire him to save credibility!
Wow! Hunter Biden is being forced to leave a Chinese Company. Now watch the Fake News wrap their greasy and very protective arms around him. Only softball questions of him please!
Thank you Denver Colorado! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! 
Great meeting with Prime Minister Abe of Japan who has just left Florida. Talked in depth about North Korea Military and Trade. Good things will happen!
Despite the Democrat inspired laws on Sanctuary Cities and the Border being so bad and one sided I have instructed the Secretary of Homeland Security not to let these large Caravans of people into our Country. It is a disgrace. We are the only Country in the World so naive! WALL
Just landed - will see everyone in Southport Indiana shortly! #MAGARallyüá∫üá∏ 
During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar - look!
Thank you Nashville Tennessee! 
Would be very SMART if Mexico would stop the Caravans long before they get to our Southern Border or if originating countries would not let them form (it is a way they get certain people out of their country and dump in U.S. No longer). Dems created this problem. No crossings!
So surprised to see Conservative thinkers like James Woods banned from Twitter and Paul Watson banned from Facebook! 
....Tariffs have had a tremendous positive impact on our Steel Industry. Plants are opening all over the U.S. Steelworkers are working again and big dollars are flowing into our Treasury. Other countries use Tariffs against but when we use them foolish people scream!
‚ÄúFBI texts have revealed anti-Trump Bias.‚Äù @FoxNews  Big News but the Fake News doesn‚Äôt want to cover. Total corruption - the Witch Hunt has turned out to be a scam! At some point soon the Mainstream Media will have to cover correctly too big a story!

Thank you Kansas! The line going into the Orlando event is over a mile long. Massive crowd expected. Leaving Kansas now be there soon!
....When I had Harley-Davidson officials over to the White House I chided them about tariffs in other countries like India being too high. Companies are now coming back to America. Harley must know that they won‚Äôt be able to sell back into U.S. without paying a big tax!
Thank you Georgia! #AmericaFirst#MakeAmericaGreatAgain  
I am the only person who can fight for the safety of our troops &amp; bring them home from the ridiculous &amp; costly Endless Wars and be scorned. Democrats always liked that position until I took it. Democrats always liked Walls until I built them. Do you see what‚Äôs happening here?
Thank you to the amazing law enforcement officers in Colorado!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #LESM 
Why are the Democrats not looking into all of the crimes committed by Crooked Hillary and the phony Russia Investigation? They would get back their credibility. Jerry Nadler Schiff  would have a whole new future open to them. Perhaps they could even run for President!

Big day for Israel. Congratulations!
I hope people are looking at the disgraceful behavior of Hillary Clinton as exposed by WikiLeaks. She is unfit to run.

....Remember NAFTA was one of the WORST Trade Deals ever made. The U.S. lost thousands of businesses and millions of jobs. We were far better off before NAFTA - should never have been signed. Even the Vat Tax was not accounted for. We make new deal or go back to pre-NAFTA!
The rank and file of the FBI are great people who are disgusted with what they are learning about Lyin‚Äô James Comey and the so-called ‚Äúleaders‚Äù of the FBI. Twelve have been fired or forced to leave. They got caught spying on my campaign and then called it an investigation. Bad!

.@politico which is not read or respected by many may be the most dishonest of the media outlets--- and that is saying something.
Such a phony hurricane report by lightweight reporter @jonkarl of @ABCWorldNews. I suggested yesterday at FEMA that along with Florida Georgia South Carolina and North Carolina even Alabama could possibly come into play which WAS true. They made a big deal about this...
In a letter to her House colleagues Nancy Pelosi said: ‚ÄúPresident Trump had a temper tantrum for us all to see.‚Äù This is not true. I was purposely very polite and calm much as I was minutes later with the press in the Rose Garden. Can be easily proven. It is all such a lie!

Moments ago it was my great honor to sign #RightToTry into law!  
Had a very good and interesting meeting at the White House with A.G. Sulzberger Publisher of the New York Times. Spent much time talking about the vast amounts of Fake News being put out by the media &amp; how that Fake News has morphed into phrase ‚ÄúEnemy of the People.‚Äù Sad!

On behalf of the American People CONGRATULATIONS! We love you! 
...Follow the money! The spy was there early in the campaign and yet never reported Collusion with Russia because there was no Collusion. He was only there to spy for political reasons and to help Crooked Hillary win - just like they did to Bernie Sanders who got duped!
Our Country was built on Tariffs and Tariffs are now leading us to great new Trade Deals - as opposed to the horrible and unfair Trade Deals that I inherited as your President. Other Countries should not be allowed to come in and steal the wealth of our great U.S.A. No longer!

...said was a total lie but Fake Media won‚Äôt show it. I am an innocent man being persecuted by some very bad conflicted &amp; corrupt people in a Witch Hunt that is illegal &amp; should never have been allowed to start - And only because I won the Election! Despite this great success!

A must read by @KimStrassel! 
Fired FBI Agent Peter Strzok is a fraud as is the rigged investigation he started. There was no Collusion or Obstruction with Russia and everybody including the Democrats know it. The only Collusion and Obstruction was by Crooked Hillary the Democrats and the DNC!
....But the questions should be asked why were all of Clinton‚Äôs people given immunity and why were the text messages of Peter S and his lover Lisa Page deleted and destroyed right after they left Mueller and after we requested them(this is Illegal)?
Republicans have a last chance to do the right thing on Repeal &amp; Replace after years of talking &amp; campaigning on it.
We protect the countries of the Middle East they would not be safe for very long without us and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices! We will remember. The OPEC monopoly must get prices down now!

Greatest Witch Hunt in the History of our Country! NO COLLUSION! Border Coyotes Drug Dealers and Human Traffickers are treated better. Who alerted CNN to be there?

No Collusion No Obstruction - there has NEVER been a President who has been more transparent. Millions of pages of documents were given to the Mueller Angry Dems plus I allowed everyone to testify including W.H. counsel. I didn‚Äôt have to do this but now they want more.....

Ron DeSantis showed great courage in his hard fought campaign to become the Governor of Florida. Congratulations to Ron and family!
The Fake News hates me saying that they are the Enemy of the People only because they know it‚Äôs TRUE. I am providing a great service by explaining this to the American People. They purposely cause great division &amp; distrust. They can also cause War! They are very dangerous &amp; sick!

....completely avoided if you by from a non-Tariffed Country or you buy the product inside the USA (the best idea). That‚Äôs Zero Tariffs. Many Tariffed companies will be leaving China for Vietnam and other such countries in Asia. That‚Äôs why China wants to make a deal so badly!...

Thank you Ohio - see you tonight! 
Had a meeting with the terrific @GovPenceIN of Indiana. So excited to campaign in his wonderful state! 
So Germany is paying Zero interest and is actually being paid to borrow money while the U.S. a far stronger and more important credit is paying interest and just stopped (I hope!) Quantitative Tightening. Strongest Dollar in History very tough on exports. No Inflation!.....
Thank you to Kurt Volker U.S. Envoy to Ukraine who said in his Congressional Testimony just released ‚ÄúYou asked what conversations did I have about that quid pro quo et cetra. NONE because I didn‚Äôt know there was a quid pro quo.‚Äù  Witch Hunt!

If Nancy Pelosi thinks that Walls are ‚Äúimmoral‚Äù why isn‚Äôt she requesting that we take down all of the existing Walls between the U.S. and Mexico even the new ones just built in San Diego at their very strong urging. Let millions of unchecked ‚Äústrangers‚Äù just flow into the U.S.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the attack strategy of harass. This is not about the Attorney General who is very sophisticated &amp; knows it isn‚Äôt about him it‚Äôs about trying to destroy President Trump through an assault on his AG for upholding the rule of law. He released a massive amount of......

Full efforts are being made to stop the onslaught of illegal aliens from crossing our Souther Border. People have to apply for asylum in Mexico first and if they fail to do that the U.S. will turn them away. The courts are asking the U.S. to do things that are not doable!
Just arrived in the United Kingdom. The only problem is that @CNN is the primary source of news available from the U.S. After watching it for a short while I turned it off. All negative &amp; so much Fake News very bad for U.S. Big ratings drop. Why doesn‚Äôt owner @ATT do something?

‚ÄúIf they try to Impeach President Trump who has done nothing wrong (No Collusion) they will end up getting him re-elected‚Äù @LindseyGrahamSC Impeachment is for High Crimes and Misdemeanors. There were no High Crimes and Misdemeanors except for those committed by the other side!

Virtually every Democrat we are dealing with today strongly supported a Border Wall or Fence. It was only when I made it an important part of my campaign because people and drugs were pouring into our Country unchecked that they turned against it. Desperately needed!

...vast sums of money to NATO &amp; the United States must be paid more for the powerful and very expensive defense it provides to Germany!
The train accident that just occurred in DuPont WA shows more than ever why our soon to be submitted infrastructure plan must be approved quickly. Seven trillion dollars spent in the Middle East while our roads bridges tunnels railways (and more) crumble! Not for long!

Great day of bilateral meetings at #ASEANSummit on trade which we are turning around to be great deals for our country! 
Only high crimes and misdemeanors can lead to impeachment. There were no crimes by me (No Collusion No Obstruction) so you can‚Äôt impeach. It was the Democrats that committed the crimes not your Republican President! Tables are finally turning on the Witch Hunt!

Honduras Mexico and many other countries that the U.S. is very generous to sends many of their people to our country through our WEAK IMMIGRATION POLICIES. Caravans are heading here. Must pass tough laws and build the WALL. Democrats allow open borders drugs and crime!
Hopefully Republican Senators good people all can quickly get together and pass a new (repeal &amp; replace) HEALTHCARE bill. Add saved $'s.
Charles Koch of Koch Brothers who claims to be giving away millions of dollars to politicians even though I know very few who have seen this (?) now makes the ridiculous statement that what President Trump is doing is unfair to ‚Äúforeign workers.‚Äù He is correct AMERICA FIRST!

Alan Dershowitz: ‚ÄúThese are not crimes. He (Mueller) has no authority to be a roving Commissioner. I don‚Äôt see any evidence of crimes.‚Äù  This is an illegal Hoax that should be ended immediately. Mueller refuses to look at the real crimes on the other side. Where is the IG REPORT?

When will the Failing New York Times admit that their front page story on the  the new Mexico deal at the Border is a FRAUD and nothing more than a badly reported ‚Äúhit job‚Äù on me something that has been going on since the first day I announced for the presidency! Sick Journalism
The military and first responders despite no electric roads phones etc. have done an amazing job. Puerto Rico was totally destroyed.
Mexico is doing NOTHING to help stop the flow of illegal immigrants to our Country. They are all talk and no action. Likewise Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador have taken our money for years and do Nothing. The Dems don‚Äôt care such BAD laws. May close the Southern Border!

Senator Rand Paul just wrote a great book ‚ÄúThe Case Against Socialism‚Äù which is now out. Highly recommended ‚Äì as America was founded on LIBERTY &amp; INDEPENDENCE ‚Äì not government coercion domination &amp; control. We were born free and will stay free as long as I am your President!
A REAL scandal is the one sided coverage hour by hour of networks like NBC &amp; Democrat spin machines like Saturday Night Live. It is all nothing less than unfair news coverage and Dem commercials. Should be tested in courts can‚Äôt be legal? Only defame &amp; belittle! Collusion?
Read the transcripts! 
The Border has been a big mess and problem for many years. At some point Schumer and Pelosi who are weak on Crime and Border security will be forced to do a real deal so easy that solves this long time problem. Schumer used to want Border security - now he‚Äôll take Crime!
Obama Administration official said they "choked" when it came to acting on Russian meddling of election. They didn't want to hurt Hillary?

DACA is probably dead because the Democrats don‚Äôt really want it they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our Military.

The Fake News is doing everything in their power to blame Republicans Conservatives and me for the division and hatred that has been going on for so long in our Country. Actually it is their Fake &amp; Dishonest reporting which is causing problems far greater than they understand!
Democrats just blocked @FoxNews from holding a debate. Good then I think I‚Äôll do the same thing with the Fake News Networks and the Radical Left Democrats in the General Election debates!

When our Country had no debt and built everything from Highways to the Military with CASH we had a big system of Tariffs. Now we allow other countries to steal our wealth treasure and jobs - But no more! The USA is doing great with unlimited upside into the future!
...and have no intention of doing anything other than going on a fishing expedition to see if they can find anything on me - both illegal &amp; unprecedented in U.S. history. There was no Collusion - Investigate the Investigators! Go to work on Drug Price Reductions &amp; Infrastructure!

The Summit with Russia was a great success except with the real enemy of the people the Fake News Media. I look forward to our second meeting so that we can start implementing some of the many things discussed including stopping terrorism security for Israel nuclear........
This memo totally vindicates ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù in probe. But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on. Their was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction (the word now used because after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING collusion is dead). This is an American disgrace!
...But most importantly @CNN is bad for the USA. Their International Division spews bad information &amp; Fake News all over the globe. This is why foreign leaders are always asking me ‚ÄúWhy does the Media hate the U.S. sooo much?‚Äù It is a fraudulent shame &amp; all comes from the top!
With Mexico being one of the highest crime Nations in the world we must have THE WALL. Mexico will pay for it through reimbursement/other.
Very smart not to be involved in the intense fighting along the Turkish Border for a change. Those that mistakenly got us into the Middle East Wars are still pushing to fight. They have no idea what a bad decision they have made. Why are they not asking for a Declaration of War?

Do you believe this?  A total Scam! 
We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall &amp; also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with. Hard to believe there was a Congress &amp; President who would approve!

No debate on Election Security should go forward without first agreeing that Voter ID (Identification) must play a very strong part in any final agreement. Without Voter ID it is all so meaningless!

Republicans on the Homeland Security Committee are wasting their time. Democrats despite all of the evidence proof and Caravans coming are not going to give money to build the DESPERATELY needed WALL. I‚Äôve got you covered. Wall is already being built I don‚Äôt expect much help!
The Democrats whose votes we need in the Senate will probably vote against Border Security and the Wall even though they know it is DESPERATELY NEEDED. If the Dems vote no there will be a shutdown that will last for a very long time. People don‚Äôt want Open Borders and Crime!
Today proves what I have always known that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.)
Imagine how much wasteful spending we‚Äôd save if we didn‚Äôt have Chuck and Nancy standing in our way! For years Democrats in Congress have depleted our military and busted our budgets on needless spending and to what end? No more.

The reason that President Obama did NOTHING about Russia after being notified by the CIA of meddling is that he expected Clinton would win..
Had a very good call last night with the President of China concerning the menace of North Korea.

Bernie Sanders endorsing Crooked Hillary Clinton is like Occupy Wall Street endorsing Goldman Sachs.

Nothing funny about tired Saturday Night Live on Fake News NBC! Question is how do the Networks get away with these total Republican hit jobs without retribution? Likewise for many other shows? Very unfair and should be looked into. This is the real Collusion!
They made up a phony collusion with the Russians story found zero proof so now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story. Nice
We must have Security at our VERY DANGEROUS SOUTHERN BORDER and we must have a great WALL to help protect us and to help stop the massive inflow of drugs pouring into our country!
Vast numbers of manufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania have moved to Mexico and other countries. That will end when I win!
Wow Matt Lauer was just fired from NBC for ‚Äúinappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace.‚Äù But when will the top executives at NBC &amp; Comcast be fired for putting out so much Fake News. Check out Andy Lack‚Äôs past!

Biden doesn‚Äôt have a clue! I will solve the China problem. 
I don‚Äôt believe the four Congresswomen are capable of loving our Country. They should apologize to America (and Israel) for the horrible (hateful) things they have said. They are destroying the Democrat Party but are weak &amp; insecure people who can never destroy our great Nation!
.....Sorry can‚Äôt let them into our Country. If too crowded tell them not to come to USA and tell the Dems to fix the Loopholes - Problem Solved!
I hereby demand a second investigation after Schumer of Pelosi for her close ties to Russia and lying about it.

....Dumb and Sick. A really bad show with low ratings - and will only get worse. CNN has been a proven and long term ratings and beyond disaster. In fact it rewarded Chris Cuomo with a now unsuccessful prime time slot despite his massive failure in the morning. Only on CNN!
Getting ready to visit Walter Reed Medical Center with Melania. Looking forward to seeing our bravest and greatest Americans!
The Syrian raid was so perfectly carried out with such precision that the only way the Fake News Media could demean was by my use of the term ‚ÄúMission Accomplished.‚Äù I knew they would seize on this but felt it is such a great Military term it should be brought back. Use often!
‚ÄúOne of the biggest things to come out of Mueller‚Äôs testimony was the fact that when he was asked was there ANYTHING that impeded your investigation the answer was a clear unequivocal NO.‚Äù Misty Marris  @FoxNews  True but many other great ‚Äúexonerating‚Äù things came out.....

Great news that an activist investor is now involved with AT&amp;T. As the owner of VERY LOW RATINGS @CNN perhaps they will now put a stop to all of the Fake News emanating from its non-credible ‚Äúanchors.‚Äù Also I hear that because of its bad ratings it is losing a fortune.....

Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November. Dems are just playing games have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem. We can pass great legislation after the Red Wave!
‚ÄúThe biggest abuse of power and corruption scandal in our history and it‚Äôs much worse than we thought. Andrew McCabe (FBI) admitted to plotting a coup (government overthrow) when he was serving in the FBI before he was fired for lying &amp; leaking.‚Äù @seanhannity @FoxNews  Treason!
These Russian individuals did their work during the Obama years. Why didn‚Äôt Obama do something about it?  Because he thought Crooked Hillary Clinton would win that‚Äôs why. Had nothing to do with the Trump Administration but Fake News doesn‚Äôt want to report the truth as usual!
We have a National Emergency at our Southern Border. The Dems refuse to do what they know is necessary - amend our immigration laws. Would immediately solve the problem! Mexico with the strongest immigration laws in the World refuses to help with illegal immigration &amp; drugs!
Happy Columbus Day!
The #SOTU speech is really boring slow lethargic - very hard to watch!
We've all wondered how Hillary avoided prosecution for her email scheme. Wikileaks may have found the answer. Obama! 
It is actually hard to believe how naive (or dumb) the Failing @nytimes is when it comes to foreign policy...weak and ineffective!
Also there are ‚ÄúNo High Crimes &amp; Misdemeanors‚Äù No Collusion No Conspiracy No Obstruction. ALL THE CRIMES ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE and that‚Äôs what the Dems should be looking at but they won‚Äôt. Nevertheless the tables are turning!

Lightweight choker Marco Rubio looks like a little boy on stage. Not presidential material!

So sad and unfair that the FCC wouldn‚Äôt approve the Sinclair Broadcast merger with Tribune. This would have been a great and much needed Conservative voice for and of the People. Liberal Fake News NBC and Comcast gets approved much bigger but not Sinclair. Disgraceful!
Remember when you hear the words "sources say" from the Fake Media often times those sources are made up and do not exist.
The story in the Amazon Washington Post of course picked up by Fake News CNN saying ‚ÄúPresident Trump asked for AG Barr to host a news conference clearing him on Ukraine‚Äù is totally untrue and just another FAKE NEWS story with anonymous sources that don‚Äôt exist....
Facebook was always anti-Trump.The Networks were always anti-Trump henceFake News @nytimes(apologized) &amp; @WaPo were anti-Trump. Collusion?

So Congressman Tim Ryan of Ohio has finally dropped out of the race for President registering ZERO in the polls &amp; unable to even qualify for the debate stage. See Tim it‚Äôs not so easy out there if you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing. He wasn‚Äôt effective for USA workers just talk!
A  story in the @washingtonpost that I was close to ‚Äúrescinding‚Äù the nomination of Justice Gorsuch prior to confirmation is FAKE NEWS. I never even wavered and am very proud of him and the job he is doing as a Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. The unnamed sources don‚Äôt exist!
Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter. This is not acceptable. They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign - there is no collusion. Get back to the basics and make us all proud!
African American unemployment is the lowest ever recorded in our country. The Hispanic unemployment rate dropped a full point in the last year and is close to the lowest in recorded history. Dems did nothing for you but get your vote!  #NeverForget  @foxandfriends

The Red Hen Restaurant should focus more on cleaning its filthy canopies doors and windows (badly needs a paint job) rather than refusing to serve a fine person like Sarah Huckabee Sanders. I always had a rule if a restaurant is dirty on the outside it is dirty on the inside!

James Comey leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION to the media. That is so illegal!

..the President when Flynn had been cleared of everything long before that. The DOJ is withholding a lot of evidence &amp; information as are Clapper &amp; Brennan &amp; all of the people who participated in the complete setup of Michael Flynn.‚Äù(Terrible!) Sidney Powell. This is a disgrace!

Melania our great and very hard working First Lady who truly loves what she is doing always thought that ‚Äúif you run you will win.‚Äù She would tell everyone that ‚Äúno doubt he will win.‚Äù I also felt I would win (or I would not have run) - and Country is doing great!
I have arrived in Scotland and will be at Trump Turnberry for two days of meetings calls and hopefully some golf - my primary form of exercise! The weather is beautiful and this place is incredible! Tomorrow I go to Helsinki for a Monday meeting with Vladimir Putin.

President Obama thought that Crooked Hillary was going to win the election so when he was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling he said it couldn‚Äôt happen was no big deal &amp; did NOTHING about it. When I won it became a big deal and the Rigged Witch Hunt headed by Strzok!

Meeting for breakfast with our Nation‚Äôs Governors - then off to Vietnam for a very important Summit with Kim Jong Un. With complete Denuclearization North Korea will rapidly become an Economic Powerhouse. Without it just more of the same. Chairman Kim will make a wise decision!
‚ÄúBased on the things I‚Äôve seen the Democrats have no case or a weak case at best. I don‚Äôt think there are or will be well founded articles of Impeachment here.‚Äù Robert Wray respected former prosecutor. It is a phony scam by the Do Nothing Dems! @foxandfriends
Our great @JudgeJeanine has just written a book that will add to the tremendous success of her last number one best seller. It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúRadicals Resistance and Revenge The Left‚Äôs Plot To Remake America.‚Äù It is a FANTASTIC book. Go get it! @foxandfriends
Congratulations to Boris Johnson on becoming the new Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. He will be great!
The most important way to stop gangs drugs human trafficking and massive crime is at our Southern Border. We need Border Security and as EVERYONE knows you can‚Äôt have Border Security without a Wall. The Drones &amp; Technology are just bells and whistles. Safety for America!
Two long running Obama era investigations of  two very popular Republican Congressmen were brought to a well publicized charge just ahead of the Mid-Terms by the Jeff Sessions Justice Department. Two easy wins now in doubt because there is not enough time. Good job Jeff......

Just spoke to Mary Barra CEO of General Motors about the Lordstown Ohio plant. I am not happy that it is closed when everything else in our Country is BOOMING. I asked her to sell it or do something quickly. She blamed the UAW Union ‚Äî I don‚Äôt care I just want it open!
Melania and I met such incredible people last night in Broward County Florida. Will never forget them or the evening!

Thank you to our amazing law enforcement officers! #MAGA 
The issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race. It is about respect for our Country Flag and National Anthem. NFL must respect this!

...can't change history but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee Stonewall Jackson - who's next Washington Jefferson? So foolish! Also...
An all concrete Wall was NEVER ABANDONED as has been reported by the media. Some areas will be all concrete but the experts at Border Patrol prefer a Wall that is see through (thereby making it possible to see what is happening on both sides). Makes sense to me!
Wow Senator Luther Strange picked up a lot of additional support since my endorsement. Now in September runoff. Strong on Wall &amp; Crime!
Congressman Kevin Brady of Texas is so popular in his District and far beyond that he doesn‚Äôt need any help - but I am giving it to him anyway. He is a great guy and the absolute ‚ÄúKing‚Äù of Cutting Taxes. Highly respected by all he loves his State &amp; Country. Strong Endorsement!
Mitt Romney never knew how to win. He is a pompous ‚Äúass‚Äù who has been fighting me from the beginning except when he begged me for my endorsement for his Senate run (I gave it to him) and when he begged me to be Secretary of State (I didn‚Äôt give it to him). He is so bad for R‚Äôs!

‚ÄúTo declassify is so important because if this were a Democrat President or a Democrat Candidate that was spied on the way President Trump was spied on this would be a scandal that would make Watergate look like nothing. Illegal spying.....

Great evening with President @EmmanuelMacron &amp; Mrs. Macron. Went to Eiffel Tower for dinner. Relationship with France stronger than ever. 
The Fake News Media worked hard to get Tiger Woods to say something that he didn‚Äôt want to say. Tiger wouldn‚Äôt play the game - he is very smart. More importantly he is playing great golf again!
Don't believe the biased and phony media quoting people who work for my campaign. The only quote that matters is a quote from me!
John Kasich should focus his special interest money on building up his failed image not negative ads on me.
Thank you to NC for last evenings great reception. The speech was a great success. Heading now to Louisiana &amp; another speech tonight in MI.
My thoughts and prayers are with the @USMC crew members who were involved in a mid-air collision off the coast of Japan. Thank you to @USForcesJapan for their immediate response and rescue efforts. Whatever you need we are here for you. @IIIMEF
Big ratings getter @seanhannity and Apprentice Champion John Rich are right now going on stage in Las Vegas for #VegasStrong. Great Show!

Will be in Houston to be with my friend. Will be a great day in Texas! 
Today it was my great honor to sign the #FirstStepAct - a monumental bi-partisan win for the American people! 
The primary plaintiff in the phony Trump University suit wants to abandon the case. Disgraceful!
.....with a President and Federal Government that wants our wonerful City and State to flourish and thrive. I Love New York!
The Washington Post is far more fiction than fact. Story after story is made up garbage - more like a poorly written novel than good reporting. Always quoting sources (not names) many of which don‚Äôt exist. Story on John Kelly isn‚Äôt true just another hit job!
Deepest condolences to the families &amp; fellow officers of the VA State Police who died today. You're all among the best this nation produces.

Mark Sanford has been very unhelpful to me in my campaign to MAGA. He is MIA and nothing but trouble. He is better off in Argentina. I fully endorse Katie Arrington for Congress in SC a state I love. She is tough on crime and will continue our fight to lower taxes. VOTE Katie!
It was wonderful to be back in Missouri where our push for historic TAX CUTS all began. Six months ago I promised that we would cut taxes to bring Main Street roaring back - and that is exactly what is happening! 
I agree with @jimcramer the Fed should lower rates. They were WAY too early to raise and Way too late to cut - and big dose quantitative tightening didn‚Äôt exactly help either. Where did I find this guy Jerome? Oh well you can‚Äôt win them all!
Tariffs are working big time. Every country on earth wants to take wealth out of the U.S. always to our detriment. I say as they comeTax them. If they don‚Äôt want to be taxed let them make or build the product in the U.S. In either event it means jobs and great wealth.....

Happy National #MedalOfHonorDay to our HEROES. We love you! 
North Carolina Governor Cooper Vetoed a Bill that would have required Sheriffs to cooperate with Ice. This is a terrible decision for the great people of North Carolina. He should reverse his decision and get back to the basics of fighting crime!

A whistleblower with second hand information? Another Fake News Story! See what was said on the very nice no pressure call. Another Witch Hunt!
This is one of the most horrible abuses of all. Those texts between gaga lovers would have told the whole story. Illegal deletion by Mueller. They gave us ‚Äúthe insurance policy.‚Äù

HILLARY'S BAD TAX HABIT! 
The big story that the Fake News Media refuses to report is lowlife Christopher Steele‚Äôs many meetings with Deputy A.G. Bruce Ohr and his beautiful wife Nelly. It was Fusion GPS that hired Steele to write the phony &amp; discredited Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary &amp; the DNC....

The LameStream Media has gone totally CRAZY! They write whatever they want seldom have sources (even though they say they do) never do ‚Äúfact checking‚Äù anymore and are only looking for the ‚Äúkill.‚Äù They take good news and make it bad. They are now beyond Fake they are Corrupt..
Baltimore‚Äôs numbers are the worst in the United States on Crime and the Economy. Billions of dollars have been pumped in over the years but to no avail. The money was stolen or wasted. Ask Elijah Cummings where it went. He should investigate himself with his Oversight Committee!
DACA was abandoned by the Democrats. Very unfair to them! Would have been tied to desperately needed Wall.
If a new HealthCare Bill is not approved quickly BAILOUTS for Insurance Companies and BAILOUTS for Members of Congress will end very soon!

Nancy just said she ‚Äújust doesn‚Äôt understand why?‚Äù Very simply without a Wall it all doesn‚Äôt work. Our Country has a chance to greatly reduce Crime Human Trafficking Gangs and Drugs. Should have been done for decades. We will not Cave!

Like many I don‚Äôt watch Saturday Night Live (even though I past hosted it) - no longer funny no talent or charm. It is just a political ad for the Dems. Word is that Kanye West who put on a MAGA hat after the show (despite being told ‚Äúno‚Äù) was great. He‚Äôs leading the charge!
Nobody knows more about Healthcare than John. Great guy! 
The Immigration Law Institute‚Äôs Christopher Hajec says ‚ÄúThe Supreme Court has to look st whether DACA is lawful. What they are looking at now is whether Trump‚Äôs recision of DACA is lawful. Must consider lawfulness of DACA itself. Looks very odd that President Trump doesn‚Äôt.....

....The Dems and their committees are going ‚Äúnuts.‚Äù The Republicans never did this to President Obama there would be no time left to run government. I hear other committee heads will do the same thing. Even stealing people who work at White House! A continuation of Witch Hunt!

Bikers for Trump at Bedminster earlier today. Thank you! 
After having written many best selling books and somewhat priding myself on my ability to write it should be noted that the Fake News constantly likes to pore over my tweets looking for a mistake. I capitalize certain words only for emphasis not b/c they should be capitalized!
If the E.U. wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on U.S. companies doing business there we will simply apply a Tax on their Cars which freely pour into the U.S. They make it impossible for our cars (and more) to sell there. Big trade imbalance!
‚ÄúBorder Patrol Agents want the Wall.‚Äù Democrat‚Äôs say they don‚Äôt want the Wall (even though they know it is really needed) and they don‚Äôt want ICE. They don‚Äôt have much to campaign on do they? An Open Southern Border and the large scale crime that comes with such stupidity!
I want to thank all Republicans for the work you have done in dealing with the Radical Left on Border Security. Not an easy task but the Wall is being built and will be a great achievement and contributor toward life and safety within our Country!

Michael Wolff is a total loser who made up stories in order to sell this really boring and untruthful book. He used Sloppy Steve Bannon who cried when he got fired and begged for his job. Now Sloppy Steve has been dumped like a dog by almost everyone. Too bad! 
Fake News has it purposely wrong. Many over ten are vying for and wanting the White House Chief of Staff position. Why wouldn‚Äôt someone want one of the truly great and meaningful jobs in Washington. Please report news correctly. Thank you!

No matter what happens today in the Senate Republican House Members should be very proud of themselves. They flew back to Washington from all parts of the World in order to vote for Border Security and the Wall. Not one Democrat voted yes and we won big. I am very proud of you!
Perhaps never in the history of our Country has someone been more thoroughly disgraced and excoriated than James Comey in the just released Inspector General‚Äôs Report. He should be ashamed of himself!

Speaking of failing badly has anyone seen what is happening to Nancy Pelosi‚Äôs district in San Francisco. It is not even recognizeable lately. Something must be done before it is too late. The Dems should stop wasting time on the Witch Hunt Hoax and start focusing on our Country!
Lou Barletta was one of my first supporters. He is tough on Crime and Borders. Will be a great Senator from Pennsylvania. His opponent is WEAK on Crime ICE and Borders. We need Lou! 
I cannot believe the level of dishonesty in the media. It is totally out of control but we are winning!
Great and we should boycott Fake News CNN. Dealing with them is a total waste of time! 
Democrats must change the Immigration Laws FAST. If not Sanctuary Cities must immediately ACT to take care of the Illegal Immigrants - and this includes Gang Members Drug Dealers Human Traffickers and Criminals of all shapes sizes and kinds. CHANGE THE LAWS NOW!

North Korea fired off some small weapons which disturbed some of my people and others but not me. I have confidence that Chairman Kim will keep his promise to me &amp; also smiled when he called Swampman Joe  Bidan a low IQ individual &amp; worse. Perhaps that‚Äôs sending me a signal?
Mark Morgan President Obama‚Äôs Border Patrol Chief gave the following message to me: ‚ÄúPresident Trump stay the course.‚Äù I agree and believe it or not we are making great progress with a system that has been broken for many years!

I have just instructed the Secretary of the Treasury to substantially increase Sanctions on the country of Iran!
Such a wonderful statement from the great @LouDobbs. "We take up what may be the most accomplished presidency in modern American history."
Congratulations Eric &amp; Lara. Very proud and happy for the two of you! 
‚ÄúThe American Media has changed forever. News organizations that seemed like a big deal are now extinct.  Those that remain have now degraded themselves beyond recognition like the New Yorker - or they‚Äôve been purchased by Jeff Bezos to conduct unregistered lobbying for.........
Thanks Jim. Would be great to just run our Country! 
‚ÄúThe real ‚ÄúObstruction of Justice‚Äù is what the Democrats are trying to do to this Attorney General.‚Äù Congressman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio). @MariaBartiromo
The Trump Haters and Angry Democrats who wrote the Mueller Report were devastated by the No Collusion finding! Nothing but a total ‚Äúhit job‚Äù which should never have been allowed to start in the first place!
I am no fan of President Obama but to show you how dishonest the phony Washington Post is: 
THANK YOU Texas I love you! 
READ THE TRANSCRIPT!
Instead of driving jobs and wealth away AMERICA will become the world's great magnet for innovation and job creati‚Ä¶ 
caught he cried like a baby and begged for forgiveness...and now he is judge &amp; jury. He should be the one who is investigated for his acts.
‚ÄúToday at the request and recommendation of the Attorney General of the United States President Donald J. Trump directed the intelligence community to quickly and fully cooperate with the Attorney General‚Äôs investigation into surveillance activities....

Hasn‚Äôt Adam Schiff been fully discredited by now? Do we have to continue listening to his lies?

The White House Correspondents‚Äô Dinner was a failure last year but this year was an embarrassment to everyone associated with it. The filthy ‚Äúcomedian‚Äù totally bombed (couldn‚Äôt even deliver her lines-much like the Seth Meyers weak performance). Put Dinner to rest or start over!
The economy is doing perhaps better than ever before and that‚Äôs prior to fixing some of the worst and most unfair Trade Deals ever made by any country. In any event they are coming along very well. Most countries agree that they must be changed but nobody ever asked!
When will the Fake Media ask about the Dems dealings with Russia &amp; why the DNC wouldn't allow the FBI to check their server or investigate?
....and have demanded transparency so that this Rigged and Disgusting Witch Hunt can come to a close. So many lives have been ruined over nothing - McCarthyism at its WORST! Yet Mueller &amp; his gang of Dems refuse to look at the real crimes on the other side - Media is even worse!
Unimaginable loss - Such great people! 
.....The Whistleblower‚Äôs lawyer is a big Democrat. The Whistleblower has ties to one of my DEMOCRAT OPPONENTS. Why does the ICIG allow this scam to continue?
India has long had a field day putting Tariffs on American products. No longer acceptable!
I believe the James Comey leaks will be far more prevalent than anyone ever thought possible. Totally illegal? Very 'cowardly!'
Even the Democrats now say that our Southern Border is a Crisis and a National Emergency. Hopefully we will not be getting any more BAD (outrageous) court decisions!
Really bad news! The Baltimore house of Elijah Cummings was robbed. Too bad!
The Democrats are allowing a ridiculous asylum system and major loopholes to remain as a mainstay of our immigration system. Mexico is likewise doing NOTHING a very bad combination for our Country. Homeland Security is being sooo very nice but not for long!
WOW! Thank you Massachusetts! See you soon. #VoteTrumpMA
Wow! The Deputy Editor of the Failing New York Times was just demoted. Should have been Fired! Totally biased and inaccurate reporting. The paper is a Fraud Zero Credibility. Fake News takes another hit but this time a big one!
Happy Birthday @SenatorDole! 
If we want to renew our PROSPERITY restore OPPORTUNITY &amp; re-establish our economic DOMINANCE then we need tax reform that is pro-growth.. 
THANK YOU @USCG! GREAT JOB!! 
....John Deere our car companies &amp; others to compete on a level playing field. With substantial Fed Cuts (there is no inflation) and no quantitative tightening the dollar will make it possible for our companies to win against any competition. We have the greatest companies...

At a recent round table meeting of business executives &amp; long after formally introducing Tim Cook of Apple I quickly referred to Tim + Apple as Tim/Apple as an easy way to save time &amp; words. The Fake News was disparagingly all over this &amp; it became yet another bad Trump story!
...there was no probable cause for believing that there was any crime collusion or otherwise or obstruction of justice!‚Äù  So stated by Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz.
‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt beat him so lets impeach him!‚Äù Democrat Rep. Al Green
Just received a copy of @SarahPalinUSA new book -- a great read! Sarah is a terrific person.
We are going to bring steel and manufacturing back to Indiana!
As the House Intelligence Committee has concluded there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump Campaign. As many are now finding out however there was tremendous leaking lying and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI Justice &amp; State. #DrainTheSwamp
Tremendous backlash against the NFL and its players for disrespect of our Country.#StandForOurAnthemüá∫üá∏
....what they were doing. There‚Äôs plenty of indication we don‚Äôt have to speculate.‚Äù @SteveDoocy ‚ÄúHoly cow got to read this book.‚Äù @ainsleyearhardt ‚ÄúWOW!‚Äù  @foxandfriends  A very serious situation. Can never be allowed to happen again! DRAIN THE SWAMP
Things are looking great for Karen H!
Statement on National Strategy for Counterterrorism:  
The Media is ‚ÄúFixed‚Äù and Corrupt. It bears no relationship to the truth. The @nytimes &amp; @washingtonpost are pure fiction. Totally dishonest reporting!
If I become the next POTUS- they will not be ignoring! #AmericaFirst 
ALABAMA get out and vote for Luther Strange - he has proven to me that he will never let you down! #MAGA
Attorney General Bill Shuette will be a fantastic Governor for the great State of Michigan. I am bringing back your jobs and Bill will help!
We must maintain a Strong Southern Border. We cannot allow our Country to be overrun by illegal immigrants as the Democrats tell their phony stories of sadness and grief hoping it will help them in the elections. Obama and others had the same pictures and did nothing about it!
Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen will be leaving her position and I would like to thank her for her service....
THANK YOU LAS VEGAS NEVADA!#NevadaCaucus #VoteTrumpNV 
In Alaska with our GREAT TROOPS departing shortly for Japan!

Happy #NationalFarmersDay! With the recent #USMCA our GREAT FARMERS will do better than ever before!! 
‚ÄúWhile Steele shopped the document to multiple media outlets he also asked for help with a RUSSIAN Oligarch.‚Äù  Catherine Herridge of @FoxNews  @LouDobbs  In other words they were colluding with Russia!
....Not only did they lose the case they had difficulty with respect to information that may have been obtained from opposing lawyers and for giving immunity in a totally incompetent fashion....
Congressman @RodBlum of Iowa got a desperately needed Flood Wall for Cedar Rapids that was almost impossible to get. He makes a BIG difference for Iowa! Border Military Vets etc. We need Rod in D.C. He has my Strong Endorsement!
‚ÄúThis was an illegal coup attempt on the President of the United States.‚Äù Dan Bongino on @foxandfriends  True!

New national poll released. Join the MOVEMENT &amp; together we will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!  
The "deplorables" came back to haunt Hillary.They expressed their feelings loud and clear. She spent big money but in the end had no game!
Ever since the passage of the Super Predator Crime Bill pushed hard by @JoeBiden together with Bill and Crooked Hillary Clinton which inflicted great pain on many but especially the African American Community Democrats have tried and failed to pass Criminal Justice Reform...
The only thing that can stop this corrupt machine is YOU. The only force strong enough to save our country is US.‚Ä¶ 
Thank you to Steve Rogers FBI Joint Terror Task Force (Ret) for his very kind and generous remarks about me and my relationship to Law Enforcement. @JudgeJeanine
It is time to remember that...
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THE PARTY OF THE AMERICAN DREAM!
When little Morty Zuckerman closes his failing @NYDailyNews will I at least be given some credit? Will happen soon.
Kris Kobach a strong and early supporter of mine is running for Governor of the Great State of Kansas.  He is a fantastic guy who loves his State and our Country - he will be a GREAT Governor and has my full &amp; total Endorsement! Strong on Crime Border &amp; Military. VOTE TUESDAY!
Zero is getting done with the Democrats in charge of the House. All they want to do is put the Mueller Report behind them and start all over again. No Do-Overs!
Yesterday‚Äôs Never Trumper witness could find NO Quid Pro Quo in the Transcript of the phone call. There were many people listening to the call. How come they (including the President of Ukraine) found NOTHING wrong with it. Witch Hunt!
.@cindyhydesmith has helped me put America First! She‚Äôs strong on the Wall is helping me create Jobs loves our Vets and fights for our conservative judges...
‚ÄúTaken for Granted‚Äù a wonderful new book by Gianni Caldwell on how Conservatism can win back the Americans that Liberalism Failed. Full Endorsement!
Rumor has it that Senator Joe Donnelly of Indiana is paying for Facebook ads for his so-called opponent on the libertarian ticket. Donnelly is trying to steal the election? Isn‚Äôt that what Russia did!?
I just approved an expedited request for a Major Disaster Declaration for the State of California. Wanted to respond quickly in order to alleviate some of the incredible suffering going on. I am with you all the way. God Bless all of the victims and families affected.
The President of the Ukraine just stated again in the strongest of language that President Trump applied no pressure and did absolutely nothing wrong. He used the strongest language possible. That should end this Democrat Scam but it won‚Äôt because the Dems &amp; Media are FIXED!
If you come after the President the Country the Flag - he‚Äôs going to defend himself. What the squad doesn‚Äôt like is that Donald Trump is enforcing the very laws that are on the books that were put there by Congress.‚Äù Jason Chaffetz. Also buy Jason‚Äôs great new book POWER GRAB!
Together we are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  
A Blue Wave means Crime and Open Borders. A Red Wave means Safety and Strength!
So Great! 
‚ÄúThe @nytimes is trying to make someone (Justice Kavanaugh) into an evil person when they don‚Äôt have the information to back it up. It is a false hoax.‚Äù @MZHemingway @MediaBuzzFNC  Zero people were fired at the Times. Why?
I never asked Comey for Personal Loyalty. I hardly even knew this guy. Just another of his many lies. His ‚Äúmemos‚Äù are self serving and FAKE!

I am at the @USGA  #USWomensOpen. An amateur player is co-leading for the first time in many decades - very exciting!
Only fools or worse are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon. THEY LOSE A FORTUNE and this will be changed. Also our fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the country...not a level playing field!
It was a pleasure to host my friends President Andrzej Duda and Mrs. Agata Kornhauser-Duda of Poland at the @WhiteHouse today. U.S.-Poland ties are at an all-time high. Thank you for being such an exemplary Ally! 
#JOBSNOTMOBS! VOTE REPUBLICAN NOW!! 
.@SadiqKhan who by all accounts has done a terrible job as Mayor of London has been foolishly ‚Äúnasty‚Äù to the visiting President of the United States by far the most important ally of the United Kingdom. He is a stone cold loser who should focus on crime in London not me......
...Hopefully the Senate will not leave Washington until our Ambassadors Judges and the people who make Washington work are approved. The Democrats are Obstructing the process and we need these people approved for the good of our Country!
MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN! 
Phylis Schlafly: 'Marco Rubio Betrayed Us All' 
...(enthusiastic dynamic and fun) and the American Legion - V.A. (respectful and strong).To bad the Dems have no one who can change tones!
Today we remember the men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice in serving. Thank you God bless your families &amp; God bless the USA!
The crisis of illegal activity at our Southern Border is real and will not stop until we build a great Steel Barrier or Wall. Let work begin!
TOGETHER WE WILL PREVAIL! 
Vietnam is thriving like few places on earth. North Korea would be the same and very quickly if it would denuclearize. The potential is AWESOME a great opportunity like almost none other in history for my friend Kim Jong Un. We will know fairly soon - Very Interesting!
Texas is heeling fast thanks to all of the great men &amp; women who have been working so hard. But still so much to do. Will be back tomorrow!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
So now they are after the legendary ‚Äúcrime buster‚Äù and greatest Mayor in the history of NYC Rudy Giuliani. He may seem a little rough around the edges sometimes but he is also a great guy and wonderful lawyer. Such a one sided Witch Hunt going on in USA. Deep State. Shameful!
Thank you to Kanye West for your nice words. Criminal Justice Reform is now law - passed in a very bipartisan way!
Leaving El Paso for the White House. What GREAT people I met there and in Dayton Ohio. The Fake News worked overtime trying to disparage me and the two trips but it just didn‚Äôt work. The love respect &amp; enthusiasm were there for all to see. They have been through so much. Sad!
Massive crowds inside and outside of the @ToyotaCenter in Houston Texas. Landing shortly - see everyone soon! #MAGAüá∫üá∏ 
....And then think what happens to China when I win. Deal would get MUCH TOUGHER! In the meantime China‚Äôs Supply Chain will crumble and businesses jobs and money will be gone!
So sad that Elijah Cummings has been able to do so little for the people of Baltimore. Statistically Baltimore ranks last in almost every major category. Cummings has done nothing but milk Baltimore dry but the public is getting wise to the bad job that he is doing!
Fake News Equals the Enemy of the People!
Mark Levin on @foxandfriends now! Great guy.
HOUSE REPUBLICANS SHOULD PASS THE STRONG BUT FAIR IMMIGRATION BILL KNOWN AS GOODLATTE II IN THEIR AFTERNOON VOTE TODAY EVEN THOUGH THE DEMS WON‚ÄôT LET IT PASS IN THE SENATE. PASSAGE WILL SHOW THAT WE WANT STRONG BORDERS &amp; SECURITY WHILE THE DEMS WANT OPEN BORDERS = CRIME.  WIN!
Statement from President Donald J. Trump and First Lady Melania Trump on the Passing of Former President George H.W. Bush 
Just spoke to Governor Rick Scott. We are working closely with law enforcement on the terrible Florida school shooting.

V.P. Mike Pence and group had a productive meeting with the Schumer/Pelosi representatives today. Many details of Border Security were discussed. We are now planning a Steel Barrier rather than concrete. It is both stronger &amp; less obtrusive. Good solution and made in the U.S.A.
So true Don and this was a big lie. Look what happened to Friends of Trump for less. Can‚Äôt let this pass! 
Senate Republicans are not voting on constitutionality or precedent they are voting on desperately needed Border Security &amp; the Wall. Our Country is being invaded with Drugs Human Traffickers &amp; Criminals of all shapes and sizes. That‚Äôs what this vote is all about. STAY UNITED!
Never in the history of our Country has the ‚Äúpress‚Äù been more dishonest than it is today. Stories that should be good are bad. Stories that should be bad are horrible. Many stories like with the REAL story on Russia Clinton &amp; the DNC seldom get reported. Too bad!
It was my great honor to welcome President @EmmanuelMacron of France to the United States here in New York City this evening! #UNGA 
My thoughts prayers and condolences are with the families friends and colleagues of the two @GCSOFlorida deputies (HEROES) who lost their lives in the line of duty today.
The Mainstream Media is out of control. They constantly lie and cheat in order to get their Radical Left Democrat views out their for all to see. It has never been this bad. They have gone bonkers &amp; no longer care what is right or wrong. This large scale false reporting is sick!
(Kiddingly) We‚Äôre building a Wall in Colorado‚Äù(then stated ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not building a Wall in Kansas but they get the benefit of the Wall we‚Äôre building on the Border‚Äù) refered to people in the very packed auditorium from Colorado &amp; Kansas getting the benefit of the Border Wall!
I will take care of the Veterans who have served this country so bravely.#ThankAVet Video:  
Today here in Iowa we honor America‚Äôs cherished farming heritage. We salute your commitment to American Energy Independence ‚Äî and we celebrate the bright future we are forging together powered by clean affordable AMERICAN ETHANOL! 
Congratulations to Bryan Steil on a wonderful win last night. Your will be replacing a great guy in Paul Ryan and your win in November will make the entire State of Wisconsin very proud. You have my complete and total Endorsement!
WE LOVE YOU LAS VEGAS! 
‚ÄúThe Report sounded an awful lot as being Comeyesque in other words I‚Äôm not going to charge this person (there wasn‚Äôt even close to being a crime) but I‚Äôm going to criticize him on the way out the door. That‚Äôs unfortunate because it‚Äôs stepping outside of the role.‚Äù Robert Ray
Social Media Giants are silencing millions of people. Can‚Äôt do this even if it means we must continue to hear Fake News like CNN whose ratings have suffered gravely. People have to figure out what is real and what is not without censorship!
Little Marco Rubio the lightweight no show Senator from Florida is just another Washington politician. 
All across this nation we pray for our country and we THANK GOD for our United States Marines! Thank you. God Bless You. And God Bless America! 
....or is he too dumb (stupid} to understand that. No wonder CNN‚Äôs ratings (MSNBC‚Äôs also) have gone down the tubes - and will stay there until they bring credibility back to the newsroom. Don‚Äôt hold your breath!
Thank you Virginia! #ImWithYou 
 
Really good news! 
Andrew McCabe FIRED a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI - A great day for Democracy. Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made McCabe look like a choirboy. He knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!
Prior to departing Wisconsin I was briefed on the shooting at Capital Gazette in Annapolis Maryland. My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families. Thank you to all of the First Responders who are currently on the scene.
Larry Kudlow on @Varneyco now!
I am continuing to monitor the censorship of AMERICAN CITIZENS on social media platforms. This is the United States of America ‚Äî and we have what‚Äôs known as FREEDOM OF SPEECH! We are monitoring and watching closely!!
Great! He said MAGA country did it. So terrible! 
The WALL which is already under construction in the form of new renovation of old and existing fences and walls will continue to be built.
Been fully briefed on earthquake in Southern California. All seems to be very much under control!
#StopTheBias 
...the entire World WAS laughing and taking advantage of us. People like liddle' Bob Corker have set the U.S. way back. Now we move forward!
Do you believe that Hillary Clinton now wants Obamacare for illegal immigrants? She should spend more time taking care of our great Vets!
On Trumps ICC Win Dems and Republicans See Eye to Eye | RealClearPolitics 
Join me live from the @WhiteHouse.
...they then used to start an investigation about Trump. It is that simple. This guy is the genesis of this whole Debacle. This was a Political hit job this was not an Intelligence Investigation. Brennan has disgraced himself he‚Äôs worried about staying out of Jail.‚Äù Dan Bongino
....to see. Importantly Ambassador Sondland‚Äôs tweet which few report stated ‚ÄúI believe you are incorrect about President Trump‚Äôs intentions. The President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo‚Äôs of any kind.‚Äù That says it ALL!
Will do a fantastic job! 
Thank you Tallahassee Florida! A beautiful evening with the MOVEMENT! Get out &amp; VOTE!#ICYMI- watch here: 
The United States is insisting that all countries that have placed artificial Trade Barriers and Tariffs on goods going into their country remove those Barriers &amp; Tariffs or be met with more than Reciprocity by the U.S.A. Trade must be fair and no longer a one way street!
The FAKE MSM is working so hard trying to get me not to use Social Media. They hate that I can get the honest and unfiltered message out.
....In the interim Hon. Robert Wilkie of DOD will serve as Acting Secretary. I am thankful for Dr. David Shulkin‚Äôs service to our country and to our GREAT VETERANS!

Everybody that loves the people of New York and all they have been thru should get hypocrites like Ted Cruz out of politics!
Unbelievable crowd of supporters in Virginia Beach Virginia. Thank you! Next stop - Cleveland Ohio.‚Ä¶ 
Big legal win today. U.S. judge sided with the Trump Administration and rejected the attempt to stop the government from building a great Border Wall on the Southern Border. Now this important project can go forward!
Just out: The USA has the absolute legal right to have apprehended illegal immigrants transferred to Sanctuary Cities. We hereby demand that they be taken care of at the highest level especially by the State of California which is well known or its poor management &amp; high taxes!
Perhaps at no time in history have the business fundamentals of U.S. companies been better than they are today!
Space Force all the way!
Ted Cruz is a cheater! He holds the Bible high and then lies and misrepresents the facts!
Kevin McCarthy @GOPLeader ‚ÄúThe President‚Äôs Tweets were not Racist. The controversy over the tweets is ALL POLITICS. I will vote against this resolution.‚Äù  Thank you Kevin!
Just arrived in Vietnam. Thank you to all of the people for the great reception in Hanoi. Tremendous crowds and so much love!
Democrats are incapable of doing a good and solid Immigration Bill!
Great news for the Republican Party as one of the dumbest &amp; most disloyal men in Congress is ‚Äúquitting‚Äù the Party. No Collusion No Obstruction! Knew he couldn‚Äôt get the nomination to run again in the Great State of Michigan. Already being challenged for his seat. A total loser!
Fantastic being in the Great State of Kentucky last night. Vote for Matt Bevin NOW! @MattBevin  One of Best Governors in U.S. He will never let you down!
Big crowd expected today in Pensacola Florida for a Make America Great Again speech. We have done so much in so short a period of time...and yet are planning to do so much more! See you there!
Just talked with Pfizer CEO and @SecAzar on our drug pricing blueprint. Pfizer is rolling back price hikes so American patients don‚Äôt pay more. We applaud Pfizer for this decision and hope other companies do the same. Great news for the American people!
How many more Never Trumpers will be allowed to testify about a perfectly appropriate phone call when all anyone has to do is READ THE TRANSCRIPT! I knew people were listening in on the call (why would I say something inappropriate?) which was fine with me but why so many?
....interview including the Vice President of the United States!
The Woodward book is a Joke - just another assault against me in a barrage of assaults using now disproven unnamed and anonymous sources. Many have already come forward to say the quotes by them like the book are fiction. Dems can‚Äôt stand losing. I‚Äôll write the real book!
‚ÄúThey wanted to know what Trump was up to with the Russians - which of course is nonsense. This whole thing was a complete setup.‚Äù George Papadopoulos to @seanhannity

I am always on the front page of the failing @nytimes but when I won the GOP nomination I'm in the back of the paper. Very dishonest!
Just landed in New Hampshire. Will be at the venue shortly. #FITN
Just like they don‚Äôt want to solve the DACA problem why didn‚Äôt the Democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the House &amp; Senate during the Obama Administration. Because they didn‚Äôt want to and now they just talk!
‚ÄúRussians had no compromising information on Donald Trump‚Äù @FoxNews  Of course not because there is none and never was. This whole Witch Hunt is an illegal disgrace...and Obama did nothing about Russia!
Congratulations to Bill Lee of Tennessee on his big primary win for Governor last night.  He ran a great campaign and now will finish off the job in November. Bill has my total and enthusiastic Endorsement!
Really good Criminal Justice Reform has a true shot at major bipartisan support. @senatemajldr Mitch McConnell and @SenSchumer have a real chance to do something so badly needed in our country. Already passed with big vote in House. Would be a major victory for ALL!
‚ÄúWhen someone gets nominated overwhelmingly and then wins the Election as he did then he gets to set the National Agenda. The press is just outrages. This @nytimes story is the most irresponsible thing I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äù @EdRollins @LouDobbs  I agree. They also lose too much!
We call for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela and we want it to happen very very soon! 
Our next Vice President of the United States of America Gov. @Mike_Pence!#GOPinCLE #GOPConvention#AmericaFirst 
Big day tomorrow in Georgia and South Carolina. ObamaCare is dead. Dems want to raise taxes big! They can only obstruct no ideas. Vote "R"
Sad case- @USATODAY did article saying I don't pay bills- false only don't pay when work is shoddy bad or not done! They should do same!
Congratulations Kimberley. Great book! 
Congratulations to Bob Kraft Bill Belichick Tom Brady and the entire New England Patriots team on a great game and season. Will be a fantastic Super Bowl!
Thank you Bill! 
We have tremendous economic power over China if our leaders knew how to use it which they don't! China's economy would collapse without us.
Mitch McConnell announced he will cancel the Senate‚Äôs August Recess. Great maybe the Democrats will finally get something done other than their acceptance of High Crime and High Taxes. We need Border Security!
Jesse &amp; Emma Great News. Congratulations!!!!! 
Happy National Ag Day! 
A Federal Judge is allowing the Nick Sandman libel suit to move forward against the thoroughly disgusting Washington Post (which is no longer available at the White House!). He could now have a good chance of winning. Go Nick!
The single greatest Witch Hunt in American history continues. There was no collusion everybody including the Dems knows there was no collusion &amp; yet on and on it goes. Russia &amp; the world is laughing at the stupidity they are witnessing. Republicans should finally take control!
Wow watch Comey lie under oath to Senator G when asked ‚Äúhave you ever been an anonymous source...or known someone else to be an anonymous source...?‚Äù He said strongly ‚Äúnever no.‚Äù He lied as shown clearly on @foxandfriends.
The large and violent French protests don‚Äôt take into account how badly the United States has been treated on Trade by the European Union or on fair and reasonable payments for our GREAT military protection. Both of these topics must be remedied soon.
Wonderful coordination between Federal State and Local Governments in the Great State of Texas - TEAMWORK! Record setting rainfall.
Great book! 

‚ÄúIt does appear it has to do with Nancy Pelosi retaining her Speakership in the next Congress. She would like that so she‚Äôs going to put it to a vote because that‚Äôs what her political left really wants.‚Äù @SteveDoocy @foxandfriends  A disgraceful use of Impeachment. Will backfire!
Loved being in Manassas VA last night. Such incredible spirit! Now in DC for a speech will then visit Old Post Office under construction.

.... It also brings Shifty‚Äôs fraudulent MADE UP CALL which he read to the United States Congress pretending it to be the words of President Trump which they were not! Nancy Pelosi is involved in this fraud in that she confirmed his fraudulent words on @GMA and much more!
I have been FAR tougher on Russia than Obama Bush or Clinton. Maybe tougher than any other President. At the same time &amp; as I have often said getting along with Russia is a good thing not a bad thing. I fully expect that someday we will have good relations with Russia again!
LYIN' TED 
America is the greatest Country in the world and my job is to fight for ALL citizens even those who have made mistakes. Congratulations to the Senate on the bi-partisan passing of a historic Criminal Justice Reform Bill....
The Democrats do not want to help DACA. Would be so easy to make a deal!
GREAT GDP numbers just released. Will be having a news conference soon!
Sorry we cannot let our friends or enemies take advantage of us on Trade anymore. We must put the American worker first!
So sad that the Department of ‚ÄúJustice‚Äù and the FBI are slow walking or even not giving the unredacted documents requested by Congress. An embarrassment to our country!
Great work by my Administration over the holidays to save Coast Guard pay during this #SchumerShutdown. No thanks to the Democrats who left town and are not concerned about the safety and security of Americans!
Thank you to the Cherokee Nation for revealing that Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas is a complete and total Fraud!
Thank you to @foxandfriends for the great timeline on all of the failures the Obama Administration had against Russia including Crimea Syria and so much more. We are now starting to win again!
There is nothing that I would want more for our Country than true FREEDOM OF THE PRESS. The fact is that the Press is FREE to write and say anything it wants but much of what it says is FAKE NEWS pushing a political agenda or just plain trying to hurt people. HONESTY WINS!
The Democrats are getting nothing done in Congress. All of their effort is about a Re-Do of the Mueller Report which didn‚Äôt turn out the way they wanted. It is not possible for them to investigate and legislate at the same time. Their heart is not into Infrastructure lower.....
The White House is running very smoothly despite phony Witch Hunts etc. There is great Energy and unending Stamina both necessary to get things done. We are accomplishing the unthinkable and setting positive records while doing so! Fake News is going ‚Äúbonkers!‚Äù
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
A despicable human being! 
Just spoke to the King of Saudi Arabia who denies any knowledge of whatever may have happened ‚Äúto our Saudi Arabian citizen.‚Äù He said that they are working closely with Turkey to find answer. I am immediately sending our Secretary of State to meet with King!
‚ÄúThe vast majority felt she should be prosecuted..." -- even senior FBI officials thought Crooked was guilty. 
The Gridiron Dinner last night was great fun. I am accomplishing a lot in Washington and have never had a better time doing something and especially since this is for the American People!
MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
Both the Judge and the lawyer in the Paul Manafort case stated loudly and for the world to hear that there was NO COLLUSION with Russia. But the Witch Hunt Hoax continues as you now add these statements to House &amp; Senate Intelligence &amp; Senator Burr. So bad for our Country!
Disgraced FBI Acting Director Andrew McCabe pretends to be a ‚Äúpoor little Angel‚Äù when in fact he was a big part of the Crooked Hillary Scandal &amp; the Russia Hoax - a puppet for Leakin‚Äô James Comey. I.G. report on McCabe was devastating. Part of ‚Äúinsurance policy‚Äù in case I won....
The irony is that the Freedom Caucus which is very pro-life and against Planned Parenthood allows P.P. to continue if they stop this plan!
The Trump Administration has terminated more UNNECESSARY Regulation in just twelve months than any other Administration has terminated during their full term in office no matter what the length. The good news is THERE IS MUCH MORE TO COME!
Just returned to the White House from the Great States of North Carolina and South Carolina where incredible work is being done on the ongoing fight against hurricane Florence. Tremendous talent and spirit!
My warmest condolences and sympathies to the victims and families of the terrible Las Vegas shooting. God bless you!
Getting ready to meet Prime Minister Abe of Japan a truly fine gentleman!
I hope corrupt Hillary Clinton chooses goofy Elizabeth Warren as her running mate. I will defeat them both.
Has anyone looked at the mistakes that John Brennan made while serving as CIA Director? He will go down as easily the WORST in history &amp; since getting out he has become nothing less than a loudmouth partisan political hack who cannot be trusted with the secrets to our country!
I didn‚Äôt call Bob Costa of the Washington Post he called me (Returned his call)!  Just more Fake News.
LETS MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!Schedule &amp; tickets:  
Humanitarian Crisis at our Southern Border. I just got back and it is a far worse situation than almost anyone would understand an invasion! I have been there numerous times - The Democrats Cryin‚Äô Chuck and Nancy don‚Äôt know how bad and dangerous it is for our ENTIRE COUNTRY....
The Endless Wars Must End!
Will be on Meet the Press with @ChuckTodd tomorrow morning. Enjoy!
I will Chair the United Nations Security Council meeting on Iran next week!
They failed on the Mueller Report they failed on Robert Mueller‚Äôs testimony they failed on everything else so now the Democrats are trying to build a case that I enrich myself by being President. Good idea except I will and have always expected to lose BILLIONS of DOLLARS..

The Fake Media is working overtime today!
Great job by all law enforcement officers and Boston Mayor @Marty_Walsh.
‚ÄúThe very thing that they are accusing President Trump of doing (which I didn‚Äôt do) was actually done by Joe Biden. Continues to be a double standard.‚Äù @RepDevinNunes  @foxandfriends  These people are stone cold Crooked. Also who is this so-called ‚Äúwhistleblower‚Äù who doesn‚Äôt...
Slippery James Comey a man who always ends up badly and out of whack (he is not smart!) will go down as the WORST FBI Director in history by far!
Across the battlefields oceans and harrowing skies of Europe and the Pacific throughout the war one great battle cry could be heard by America‚Äôs friends and foes alike:‚ÄúREMEMBER PEARL HARBOR.‚Äù 
The Greatest Political Hoax of all time! Crimes were committed by Crooked Dirty Cops and DNC/The Democrats.
House Intelligence Committee rules that there was NO COLLUSION between the Trump Campaign and Russia. As I have been saying all along it is all a big Hoax by the Democrats based on payments and lies. There should never have been a Special Counsel appointed. Witch Hunt!
...I am hopeful Congress will engage with my Team to pass meaningful legislation that will make a real difference and most importantly Save Lives!
Representative Devin Nunes a man of tremendous courage and grit may someday be recognized as a Great American Hero for what he has exposed and what he has had to endure!
Thank you to Sue Kruczek who lost her wonderful and talented son Nick to the Opioid scourge for your kind words while on @foxandfriends. We are fighting this terrible epidemic hard - Nick will not have died in vain!
...to terrorism and airline flight safety. Humanitarian reasons plus I want Russia to greatly step up their fight against ISIS &amp; terrorism.
Thank you to Kanye West and the fact that he is willing to tell the TRUTH. One new and great FACT - African American unemployment is the lowest ever recorded in the history of our Country. So honored by this. Thank you Kanye for your support. It is making a big difference!

So beautiful....Show this picture to the NFL players who still kneel! 
Congratulations to America‚Äôs new Secretary of @HHSGov Alex Azar! 
Can you believe that the Radical Left Democrats want to do our new and very important Census Report without the all important Citizenship Question. Report would be meaningless and a waste of the $Billions (ridiculous) that it costs to put together!
The U.S. once again condemns the brutality of the North Korean regime as we mourn its latest victim. Video: 
There was no Collusion (it is a Hoax) and there is no Obstruction of Justice (that is a setup &amp; trap). What there is is Negotiations going on with North Korea over Nuclear War Negotiations going on with China over Trade Deficits Negotiations on NAFTA and much more. Witch Hunt!
‚ÄúThe story of Puerto Rico is the rebuilding that has occurred. The President has done an extraordinary job of cleanup rebuilding electrical stuff and everything else.‚Äù  @EdRollins   ‚ÄúThe people of Puerto Rico have one of the most corrupt governments in our country.‚Äù @LouDobbs
The Fake News Media is working hard so that information about the Whistleblower‚Äôs identity which may be very bad for them and their Democrat partners never reaches the Public.
There is nothing racist in stating plainly what most people already know that Elijah Cummings has done a terrible job for the people of his district and of Baltimore itself. Dems always play the race card when they are unable to win with facts. Shame!
Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Councilhe will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!
.....much tougher game than the Republicans did when they had the House Majority. Republicans will remember! ‚ÄúThis has already been argued before the U.S. Supreme Court but the House doesn‚Äôt want to wait. This is a common thread between all of the Committees - do whatever you...
@NYGovCuomo @NYCMayor ...fully supports any and all of their efforts with respect to the West Side attack. #NYCStrong
The only reason irrelevant @GlennBeck doesn't like me is I refused to do his failing show - asked many times. Very few listeners - sad!
Republicans are now leading the Generic Poll perhaps because of the popular Tax Cuts which the Dems want to take away. Actually they want to raise you taxes substantially. Also they want to do nothing on DACA R‚Äôs want to fix!
Our great U.S. Border Patrol Agents made the biggest Fentanyl bust in our Country‚Äôs history. Thanks as always for a job well done!
Great @Cabinet meeting at the @WhiteHouse this morning!  
We must have Border Security get rid of Chain Lottery Catch &amp; Release Sanctuary Cities - go to Merit based Immigration. Protect ICE and Law Enforcement and of course keep building but much faster THE WALL!
.....Except the results are FAR BETTER than I ever said they were going to be! I campaigned against the NEVER ENDING WARS remember!
‚ÄúWe cannot have what happened to this President happen again.‚Äù Joe DiGenova.  ‚ÄúIt is time for Justice to come barreling in.‚Äù @LouDobbs  Can you imagine that with everything going on in this World the Witch Hunt though on a respirator is still whimpering along. A disgrace!
Just as I said Alabama was originally projected to be hit. The Fake News denies it! 
Congratulations to the GREAT Bob Cousy! 
THANK YOU ORLANDO FLORIDA!
I am on my way to Singapore where we have a chance to achieve a truly wonderful result for North Korea and the World. It will certainly be an exciting day and I know that Kim Jong-un will work very hard to do something that has rarely been done before...
Chicago will never stop its crime wave with the current Superintendent of Police. It just won‚Äôt happen! Thank you to Kevin Graham and all of the GREAT Chicago Police Officers I just had the privilege to meet. Tremendous crime fighting potential if allowed to do your thing!
Democrats can‚Äôt impeach a Republican President for crimes committed by Democrats. The facts are ‚Äúpouring‚Äù in. The Greatest Witch Hunt in American History! Congress go back to work and help us at the Border with Drug Prices and on Infrastructure.
Now that the Democrats and the Fake News Media have gone ‚Äúbust‚Äù on every other of their Witch Hunt schemes they are trying to start one just as ridiculous as the others call it the Ukraine Witch Hunt while at the same time trying to protect Sleepy Joe Biden. Will fail again!
Great couple great book! 
I will replace it with private plans health savings accounts &amp; allow purchasing across state lines. Maximum choice &amp; freedom for consumer.
You would think a paper like the Washington Post would be fair and objective. For the record almost all polls showed I won all debates.
Uganda must find the kidnappers of the American Tourist and guide before people will feel safe in going there. Bring them to justice openly and quickly!
Obviously the European Union as represented by @JunckerEU and the United States as represented by yours truly love each other! 
Democrat Dianne Feinstein should never have released secret committee testimony to the public without authorization. Very disrespectful to committee members and possibly illegal. She blamed her poor decision on the fact she had a cold - a first!

Dana Rohrabacher has been a great Congressman for his District and for the people of Cal. He works hard and is respected by all - he produces! Dems are desperate to replace Dana by spending vast sums to elect a super liberal who is weak on Crime and bad for our Military &amp; Vets!
Don‚Äôt forget we are building and renovating big sections of Wall right now. Moving quickly and will cost far less than previous politicians thought possible. Building after all is what I do best even when money is not readily available!

We cannot let those killed in El Paso Texas and Dayton Ohio die in vain. Likewise for those so seriously wounded. We can never forget them and those many who came before them. Republicans and Democrats must come together and get strong background checks perhaps marrying....

The OPEC Monopoly must remember that gas prices are up &amp; they are doing little to help. If anything they are driving prices higher as the United States defends many of their members for very little $‚Äôs. This must be a two way street. REDUCE PRICING NOW!
Facebook has just stated that they are setting up a system to ‚Äúpurge‚Äù themselves of Fake News. Does that mean CNN will finally be put out of business?
I thought people weren‚Äôt celebrating? They were cheering all over even this savage from Orlando. I was right.

I employ many people in the State of Virginia - JOBS JOBS JOBS! Crooked Hillary will sell us out just like her husband did with NAFTA.
The top Leadership and Investigators of the FBI and the Justice Department have politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of Democrats and against Republicans - something which would have been unthinkable just a short time ago. Rank &amp; File are great people!
James Comey illegally leaked classified documents to the press in order to generate a Special Council? Therefore the Special Council was established based on an illegal act? Really does everybody know what that means?

What kind of a lawyer would tape a client? So sad! Is this a first never heard of it before? Why was the tape so abruptly terminated (cut) while I was presumably saying positive things? I hear there are other clients and many reporters that are taped - can this be so? Too bad!
After years of Comey with the phony and dishonest Clinton investigation (and more) running the FBI its reputation is in Tatters - worst in History! But fear not we will bring it back to greatness.
Puerto Rico is one of the most corrupt places on earth. Their political system is broken and their politicians are either Incompetent or Corrupt. Congress approved Billions of Dollars last time more than anyplace else has ever gotten and it is sent to Crooked Pols. No good!....

Many Democrats are deeply concerned about the fact that their ‚Äúleadership‚Äù wants to denounce and abandon the great men and women of ICE thereby declaring war on Law &amp; Order. These people will be voting for Republicans in November and in many cases joining the Republican Party!
Beautiful evening in Kinston North Carolina - thank you! Get out and VOTE!! You can watch tonight's rally here:‚Ä¶ 
Thank you Waukesha Wisconsin! Full transcript of my speech #FollowTheMoney: 
Just another FAKE SUPPRESSION POLL this time from @FoxNews of course! 
There is no limit to what NoKo can achieve when it gives up its nuclear weapons and embraces commerce &amp; engagement w/ the world. Chairman Kim has before him the opportunity to be remembered as the leader who ushered in a glorious new era of security &amp; prosperity for his citizens! 
The  Amazon Washington Post and @CNN just did a Fake Interview on Pardons for Aids on the Wall and that I didn‚Äôt think the Wall on the Southern Border was that important to stop Illegals wanting to come into our Country. WRONG vitally important. Will make a BIG impact. So bad!
#CrookedHillary 
Today in the East Room of the @WhiteHouse it was my true privilege to award seven extraordinary Americans with the Presidential Medal of Freedom...
CLINTON‚ÄôS FLAILING SYRIA POLICY WAS JUDGED A FAILURE: #VPDebate
More than a century after conquering flight the #WrightBrothers continue to motivate &amp; inspire Americans who never tire of exploration &amp; innovation. This GREAT AMERICAN SPIRIT can be found in the design of every new supersonic jet and next generation:  
Join me tomorrow in Plymouth New Hampshire! #FITN #NHPrimary 
FEMA has been told directly by me to give the A Plus treatment to the Great State of Alabama and the wonderful people who have been so devastated by the Tornadoes. @GovIvey one of the best in our Country has been so informed. She is working closely with FEMA (and me!).
Making America Safe is my number one priority. We will not admit those into our country we cannot safely vet.
Congratulations to @JustinTrudeau on a wonderful and hard fought victory. Canada is well served. I look forward to working with you toward the betterment of both of our countries!
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or CFPB has been a total disaster as run by the previous Administrations pick. Financial Institutions have been devastated and unable to properly serve the public. We will bring it back to life!
I will be campaigning in Indiana all day. Things are looking great and the support of Bobby Knight has been so amazing. Today will be fun!
Will be going to West Virginia and Indiana today TWO RALLIES! Don‚Äôt tell anyone (big secret) but I will be bringing Coach Bobby Knight to Indiana. He‚Äôs been a supporter right from the beginning of the Greatest Political Movement in American History!
Unbelievable crowd in Florida tonight. Get out and VOTE! #MAGAüá∫üá∏ 
Officials behind the now discredited "Dossier" plead the Fifth. Justice Department and/or FBI should immediately release who paid for it.
Rep. Adam Schiff totally made up my conversation with Ukraine President and read it to Congress and Millions. He must resign and be investigated. He has been doing this for two years. He is a sick man!
The U.S. is respected again! 
John Kerry can‚Äôt get over the fact that he had his chance and blew it! Stay away from negotiations John you are hurting your country!
Big news - Budget just passed!
House Intelligence Committee rules that there was NO COLLUSION between the Trump Campaign and Russia. As I have been saying all along it is all a big Hoax by the Democrats based on payments and lies. There should never have been a Special Councel appointed. Witch Hunt!
'Small business says Trump is their pick for president'
Almost everyone agrees that my Administration has done more in less than two years than any other Administration in the history of our Country. I‚Äôm tough as hell on people &amp; if I weren‚Äôt nothing would get done. Also I question everybody &amp; everything-which is why I got elected!
A new INTELLIGENCE LEAK from the Amazon Washington Postthis time against A.G. Jeff Sessions.These illegal leaks like Comey's must stop!
Just landed in Iowa. See everyone soon! #MAGAüá∫üá∏

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN which is happening and then KEEP AMERICA GREAT!
Violent crime is rising across the United States yet the DNC convention ignored it. Crime reduction will be one of my top priorities.
Highly respected author Christopher Bedford just came out with book "The Art of the Donald Lessons from America's...." Really good book!
Congratulations to Prime Minister @NarendraModi and his BJP party on their BIG election victory! Great things are in store for the US-India partnership with the return of PM Modi at the helm. I look forward to continuing our important work together!
...and International. We have only one real currency in the USA and it is stronger than ever both dependable and reliable. It is by far the most dominant currency anywhere in the World and it will always stay that way. It is called the United States Dollar!
Donna Brazile Shreds Obama Economy - Acting DNC chair says 'people are more in despair about how things are' 
The Democrats now own the shutdown!
Our Southern Border is under siege. Congress must act now to change our weak and ineffective immigration laws. Must build a Wall. Mexico which has a massive crime problem is doing little to help!
Honored to receive an endorsement from @SJSOPIO - thank you! Together we are going to MAKE AMERICA SAFE &amp; GREAT AG‚Ä¶ 
Thank you West Virginia - I love you! 
A great evening in beautiful Minnesota! 
The Mueller Witch Hunt is a total disgrace. They are looking at supposedly stolen Crooked Hillary Clinton Emails (even though they don‚Äôt want to look at the DNC Server) but have no interest in the Emails that Hillary DELETED &amp; acid washed AFTER getting a Congressional Subpoena!
Bob Hugin successful all of his life would be a Great Senator from New Jersey. He has my complete and total Endorsement! Get out and Vote for Bob.
While I like the Vaping alternative to Cigarettes we need to make sure this alternative is SAFE for ALL! Let‚Äôs get counterfeits off the market and keep young children from Vaping!

‚ÄúWhen your making an unsubstantiated charge that the President of the United States is making a request having to do with quid pro quo this witness has blown a big hole into that statement.The Ambassador put a dagger in the heart of Schiffs fairytale.‚Äù  Rep. Lee Zeldin @FoxNews
Arriving @TrumpScotland with @DonaldJTrumpJr &amp; @EricTrump. Back to New York tonight. Video: 
Sounding more and more like the so-called Whistleblower isn‚Äôt a Whistleblower at all. In addition all second hand information that proved to be so inaccurate that there may not have even been somebody else a leaker or spy feeding it to him or her? A partisan operative?
After North Korea missile launch it's more important than ever to fund our gov't &amp; military! Dems shouldn't hold troop funding hostage for amnesty &amp; illegal immigration. I ran on stopping illegal immigration and won big. They can't now threaten a shutdown to get their demands.
Thank you Charlotte North Carolina. Great afternoon! #ICYMI - I delivered a speech on urban renewal. Full speech:‚Ä¶ 
Join us in Sparks Nevada today! #NevadaCaucus #VoteTrumpNV 
Thank you Carmel Indiana! Get out &amp; #VoteTrump tomorrow! #INPrimary #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 
Crooked Hillary Clinton spent hundreds of millions of dollars more on Presidential Election than I did. Facebook was on her side not mine!
Today we express our deepest gratitude to all those who have served in our armed forces. #ThankAVet 
....reports are coming. Comey very vulnerable. But where is the Supreme Court. Where is Justice Roberts? If you lie to a court you should be held in contempt. So if you abused the FISA you must be held accountable. I hope Justice Roberts will take action.‚Äù Jason Chaffetz Fox
Instead of driving jobs and wealth away AMERICA will become the world's great magnet for INNOVATION &amp; JOB CREATION.
The DEDUCTIBLE which comes with ObamaCare is so high that it is practically not even useable! Hurts families badly. We have a chance working with the Democrats to deliver great HealthCare! A confirming Supreme Court Decision will lead to GREAT HealthCare results for Americans!
Statement Regarding Recent Executive Order Concerning Extreme Vetting: 
What‚Äôs going on at @CNN is happening to different degrees at other networks - with @NBCNews being the worst. The good news is that Andy Lack(y) is about to be fired(?) for incompetence and much worse. When Lester Holt got caught fudging my tape on Russia they were hurt badly!
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain! 
Was the brother of John Podesta paid big money to get the sanctions on Russia lifted? Did Hillary know?
I want to thank Steve Bannon for his service. He came to the campaign during my run against Crooked Hillary Clinton - it was great! Thanks S
Join me in Crosby Texas as I deliver remarks and sign Executive Orders on Energy and Infrastructure! 
Now we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to RESTORE AMERICAN PROSPERITY ‚Äì and RECLAIM AMERICA‚ÄôS DESTINY.But in order to achieve this bright and glowing future the SENATE MUST PASS TAX CUTS ‚Äì and bring Main Street roaring back to life! 
Department of Justice should have urged the Supreme Court to at least hear the Drivers License case on illegal immigrants in Arizona. I agree with @LouDobbs. Should have sought review.
Obamacare is a disaster. We must REPEAL &amp; REPLACE. Tired of the lies and want to #DrainTheSwamp? Get out &amp; VOTE‚Ä¶ 
Things will work out fine between the U.S.A. and Russia. At the right time everyone will come to their senses &amp; there will be lasting peace!
If @TedCruz doesn‚Äôt clean up his act stop cheating &amp; doing negative ads I have standing to sue him for not being a natural born citizen.
...case against him &amp; now wants to clear his name by showing "the false or misleading testimony by James Comey John Brennan..." Witch Hunt!
Thank you Governor @ScottWalker &amp; @GOP Chairman @Reince Priebus. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #ImWithYou
I met with the DOJ concerning the declassification of various UNREDACTED documents. They agreed to release them but stated that so doing may have a perceived negative impact on the Russia probe. Also key Allies‚Äô called to ask not to release. Therefore the Inspector General.....
Pay-to-play. Collusion. Cover-ups. And now bribery? So CROOKED. I will #DrainTheSwamp. 
Thank you Joe and remember the BRAIN is much sharper also! 
‚ÄúI‚Äôve been skeptical about the collusion and obstruction claims for the last year. I just don‚Äôt see the evidence....in terms of the collusion it‚Äôs all a bit implausible based on the evidence we have.‚Äù  Jonathan Turley on @FoxNews
Democrats don‚Äôt want to fix the loopholes at the Border. They don‚Äôt want to do anything. Open Borders and crime!
The E.U. and China will further lower interest rates and pump money into their systems making it much easier for their manufacturers to sell product. In the meantime and with very low inflation our Fed does nothing - and probably will do very little by comparison. Too bad!
It was my great honor to host a celebration of Diwali the Hindu Festival of Lights in the Roosevelt Room at the @WhiteHouse this afternoon. Very very special people!  
President Xi and I have a very strong and personal relationship. He and I are the only two people that can bring about massive and very positive change on trade and far beyond between our two great Nations. A solution for North Korea is a great thing for China and ALL!
....countries that know how to play the game against the U.S. That‚Äôs actually why the E.U. was formed....and for China until now the U.S. has been ‚Äúeasy pickens.‚Äù The Fed has made all of the wrong moves. A small rate cut is not enough but we will win anyway!
@ThePlumLineGS MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Can‚Äôt believe that Rolling Thunder would be given a hard time with permits in Washington D.C. They are great Patriots who I have gotten to know and see in action. They love our Country and love our Flag. If I can help I will!
Beautiful evening in New Mexico with Great American Patriots! 
Today it was my great honor to welcome Prime Minister @Netanyahu of Israel back to the @WhiteHouse where I signed a Presidential Proclamation recognizing Israel‚Äôs sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Read more:  
We need to be smart vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!
They don‚Äôt have a clue but I do. The USA is doing great despite the Fed! 
Where are @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan and @Raul_Labrador?#RepealANDReplace #Obamacare
I am pleased to announce that Jovita Carranza will be nominated as the new @SBAgov Administrator. She will be replacing Linda McMahon who has done an outstanding job. Jovita was a great Treasurer of the United States ‚Äì and I look forward to her joining my Cabinet!
The Washington Post is constantly quoting ‚Äúanonymous sources‚Äù that do not exist. Rarely do they use the name of anyone because there is no one to give them the kind of negative quote that they are looking for. They are a disgrace to journalism but then again so are many others!
‚ÄúThe FBI received documents from Bruce Ohr (of the Justice Department &amp; whose wife Nelly worked for Fusion GPS).‚Äù Disgraced and fired FBI Agent Peter Strzok. This is too crazy to be believed! The Rigged Witch Hunt has zero credibility.
A very good start! Please all work hard to get a final deal. 
Big legislation will be signed by me shortly. After many years RIGHT TO TRY and big changes to DODD FRANK.
The greatest influence over our election was the Fake News Media "screaming" for Crooked Hillary Clinton. Next she was a bad candidate!
'President-Elect Donald J. Trump Nominates Elaine Chao as Secretary of the Department of Transportation'
....Likewise do not want the Kurds to provoke Turkey. Russia Iran and Syria have been the biggest beneficiaries of the long term U.S. policy of destroying ISIS in Syria - natural enemies. We also benefit but it is now time to bring our troops back home. Stop the ENDLESS WARS!
The military drills or war games as I call them were never even discussed in my mtg w/ Kim Jong Un of NK‚ÄîFAKE NEWS! I made that decision long ago because it costs the U.S. far too much money to have those ‚Äúgames‚Äù especially since we are not reimbursed for the tremendous cost!
It was my great honor to host a @WhiteHouse Conference on Supporting Veterans &amp; Military Families...To everyone here today who has served our Country in uniform &amp; to every Veteran &amp; Military family across our land I want to express the eternal gratitude of our entire Nation! 
The Fake News Media works hard at disparaging &amp; demeaning my use of social media because they don't want America to hear the real story!
‚ÄúThe FBI closed the case on Hillary which was a rigged investigation. They exonerated her even before they ever interviewed her they never even put her under oath.....‚Äù and much more. So true Jesse! @WattersWorld
Thank you @RandPaul. ‚ÄúThe President has gone through a year and a half of totally partisan investigations - what‚Äôs he supposed to think?‚Äù
Great to be in Singapore excitement in the air!
Great news! Tonight we broke the all-time attendance record previously held by Elton John at #SNHUArena in Manchester New Hampshire! 
S&amp;P opens at Record High!
Pennsylvania - Don‚Äôt forget to get out and VOTE TODAY for Republican Fred Keller for Congress. Fred is Strong on Crime Second Amendment Military Vets and Healthcare. He has my Complete and Total Endorsement!
We should have a contest as to which of the Networks plus CNN and not including Fox is the most dishonest corrupt and/or distorted in its political coverage of your favorite President (me). They are all bad. Winner to receive the FAKE NEWS TROPHY!
...confidence that President Al Sisi will handle situation properly.
Hillary Clinton‚Äôs Emails many of which are Classified Information got hacked by China. Next move better be by the FBI &amp; DOJ or after all of their other missteps (Comey McCabe Strzok Page Ohr FISA Dirty Dossier etc.) their credibility will be forever gone!
I am very excited about the person who will be taking the place of Don McGahn as White House Counsel! I liked Don but he was NOT responsible for me not firing Bob Mueller or Jeff Sessions. So much Fake Reporting and Fake News!
The Failing New York Times wrote a story that made it seem like the White House Councel had TURNED on the President when in fact it is just the opposite - &amp; the two Fake reporters knew this. This is why the Fake News Media has become the Enemy of the People. So bad for America!
 
David Brooks of the New York Times is closing in on being the dumbest of them all. He doesn‚Äôt have a clue.
Hillary Lies to Benghazi Families#CrookedHillary 
.....But we are winning big and they will soon be on our turf.
....is not Constitutionally Permissable.‚Äù Alan Dershowitz Constitutional Lawyer
To show you how dishonest the LameStream Media is I used the word Liddle‚Äô not Liddle in discribing Corrupt Congressman Liddle‚Äô Adam Schiff. Low ratings @CNN purposely took the hyphen out and said I spelled the word little wrong. A small but never ending situation with CNN!
While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers.
I'm at Trump Doral right now Tiger will tee off shortly.
Statement on the Iran Nuclear Deal: 
....agencies not just the FBI &amp; DOJ now the State Department to dig up dirt on him in the days leading up to the Election. Comey had conversations with Donald Trump which I don‚Äôt believe were accurate...he leaked information (corrupt).‚Äù Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch on @FoxNews
It was an honor to welcome President Al Sisi of Egypt to the @WhiteHouse as we renew the historic partnership betwe‚Ä¶ 
...have shown conclusively that there was no Collusion with Russia..just excuse for losing. The only Collusion was that done by the DNC the Democrats and Crooked Hillary. The writer of the story Maggie Haberman a Hillary flunky knows nothing about me and is not given access.
The Democrats are turning down services and security for citizens in favor of services and security for non-citizens. Not good!
If Iran wants to fight that will be the official end of Iran. Never threaten the United States again!
I had an excellent telephone conversation with Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador President of Mexico talking about Southern Border Security and various other things of mutual interest for the people of our respective countries....
Leakin‚Äô Lyin‚Äô James Comey! 
The Failing @nytimes story on Mexico and Illegal Immigration through our Southern Border has now been proven shockingly false and untrue bad reporting and the paper is embarrassed by it. The only problem is that they knew it was Fake News before it went out. Corrupt Media!
Uranium deal to Russia with Clinton help and Obama Administration knowledge is the biggest story that Fake Media doesn't want to follow!
....I don‚Äôt want to Win for myself I only want to Win for the people. The New @FoxNews is letting millions of GREAT people down! We have to start looking for a new News Outlet. Fox isn‚Äôt working for us anymore!
...about then candidate Trump." Catherine Herridge @FoxNews. So why doesn't Fake News report this? Witch Hunt! Purposely phony reporting.
Dwyane Wade's cousin was just shot and killed walking her baby in Chicago. Just what I have been saying. African-Americans will VOTE TRUMP!
If President Obama made the deals that I have made both at the Border and for the Economy the Corrupt Media would be hailing them as Incredible &amp; a National Holiday would be immediately declared. With me despite our record setting Economy and all that I have done no credit!
Thank you @PeterSchweizer! 
In America we don't worship government - we worship God. #ValuesVotersSummit 
Don‚Äôt worry the Republicans and your President will fix it! 
Looks like Jerry Brown and California are not looking for safety and security along their very porous Border. He cannot come to terms for the National Guard to patrol and protect the Border. The high crime rate will only get higher. Much wanted Wall in San Diego already started!
I am allowing Japan &amp; South Korea to buy a substantially increased amount of highly sophisticated military equipment from the United States.
Do you notice we are not having a gun debate right now? That's because they used knives and a truck!
.@jessebwatters You did a great job hosting @oreillyfactor. Everybody loved it! Thank you for the nice words.
Wow ‚ÄúFBI lawyer James Baker reassigned‚Äù according to @FoxNews.
This week the Senate can join the House &amp; take a strong stand for the Middle Class families who are the backbone of America. Together we will give the American people a big beautiful Christmas present-a massive tax cut that lets Americans keep more of their HARD-EARNED MONEY! 
Even Michael Moore agrees that the Dems and Mueller blew it! 
Sadly Democrats want to stop paying our troops and government workers in order to give a sweetheart deal not a fair deal for DACA. Take care of our Military and our Country FIRST!
The Washington Post is far more fiction than fact. Story after story is made up made garbage - more like a poorly written novel than good reporting. Always quoting sources (not names) many of which don‚Äôt exist. Story on John Kelly isn‚Äôt true...just another hit job!
‚ÄúYou had Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party try to hide the fact that they gave money to GPS Fusion to create a Dossier which was used by their allies in the Obama Administration to convince a Court misleadingly by all accounts to spy on the Trump Team.‚Äù Tom Fitton JW
CNN is being torn apart from within based on their being caught in a major lie and refusing to admit the mistake. Sloppy @carlbernstein a man who lives in the past and thinks like a degenerate fool making up story after story is being laughed at all over the country! Fake News
Thank you Newt!

‚ÄúPresident Trump Calls the U.S.-France Relationship ‚ÄòUnbreakable.‚Äô History Shows He‚Äôs Right.‚Äù 
The Mainstream Media is under fire and being scorned all over the World as being corrupt and FAKE. For two years they pushed the Russian Collusion Delusion when they always knew there was No Collusion. They truly are the Enemy of the People and the Real Opposition Party!
‚ÄúI will never testify against Trump.‚Äù This statement was recently made by Roger Stone essentially stating that he will not be forced by a rogue and out of control prosecutor to make up lies and stories about ‚ÄúPresident Trump.‚Äù Nice to know that some people still have ‚Äúguts!‚Äù
THANK YOU- Clemson South Carolina! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #SCPrimary

.....shouting of the F...word among many other terrible things and the petrified Dems run for the hills. Why isn‚Äôt the House voting to rebuke the filthy and hate laced things they have said? Because they are the Radical Left and the Democrats are afraid to take them on. Sad!
Great going Tate! 
After a great rally in Panama City Beach Florida - I am returning to Washington D.C. with @SenRickScott and Senator @MarcoRubio discussing the terrible abuses by Maduro. America stands with the GREAT PEOPLE of Venezuela for however long it takes!

ObamaCare is causing such grief and tragedy for so many. It is being dismantled but in the meantime premiums &amp; deductibles are way up!
It was my great honor to host the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act Roundtable today at the @WhiteHouse!

Massive overflow crowd tonight in Erie Pennsylvania. THANK YOU to everyone who came out and joined us. Together we are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
Mexico is making a fortune on NAFTA...They have very strong border laws - ours are pathetic. With all of the money they make from the U.S. hopefully they will stop people from coming through their country and into ours at least until Congress changes our immigration laws!
Thank you Dallas Texas!  
A terrible lie. How can she do such a thing? 
Mark Penn  ‚ÄúWhy are there people from the Clinton Foundation on the Mueller Staff? Why is there an Independent Counsel? To go after people and their families for unrelated offenses...Constitution was set up to prevent this...Stormtrooper tactics almost.‚Äù A disgrace!
Brian Kemp is running for Governor of the great state of Georgia. The Primary is on Tuesday. Brian is tough on crime strong on the border and illegal immigration. He loves our Military and our Vets and protects our Second Amendment. I give him my full and total endorsement.
If you don‚Äôt have Borders you don‚Äôt have a Country!
The Economy is soooo good perhaps the best in our country‚Äôs history (remember it‚Äôs the economy stupid!) that the Democrats are flailing &amp; lying like CRAZY! Phony books articles and T.V. ‚Äúhits‚Äù like no other pol has had to endure-and they are losing big. Very dishonest people!

What ever happened to the Server at the center of so much Corruption that the Democratic National Committee REFUSED to hand over to the hard charging (except in the case of Democrats) FBI? They broke into homes &amp; offices early in the morning but were afraid to take the Server?
Because of the Democrats intransigence on Border Security and the great importance of Safety for our Nation I am respectfully cancelling my very important trip to Davos Switzerland for the World Economic Forum. My warmest regards and apologies to the @WEF!

Very important that OPEC increase the flow of Oil. World Markets are fragile price of Oil getting too high. Thank you!
Very importantly @RepDanDonovan will win for the Republicans in November...and his opponent will not. Remember Alabama. We can‚Äôt take any chances on losing to a Nancy Pelosi controlled Democrat!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Due to the horrific events taking place in our country I have decided to postpone my speech on economic opportunity- today in Miami.
No deal was made last night on DACA. Massive border security would have to be agreed to in exchange for consent. Would be subject to vote.

Wow! This might be my highest # yet! Thank you to my opposition- you are totally ineffective &amp; have been for years! 
Nervous Nancy Pelosi is a disgrace to herself and her family for having made such a disgusting statement especially since I was with foreign leaders overseas. There is no evidence for such a thing to have been said. Nervous Nancy &amp; Dems are getting Zero work done in Congress...
Today I am directing my Administration to explore all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect the free speech rights of ALL AMERICANS. We hope to see more transparency more accountability and more FREEDOM! #SocialMediaSummit 
Democrats in Congress must no longer Obstruct - vote to fix our terrible Immigration Laws now. I am watching what is going on from Europe - it would be soooo simple to fix. Judges run the system and illegals and traffickers know how it works. They are just using children!
Congratulations to @JudgeJeanine Pirro on having again the Number One Best Selling Book!
What a disgraceful legal system for this guy to still be around after all of these years. A vicious killer who destroyed so many great people &amp; families!

....because their so-called story didn‚Äôt come even close to matching up with the exact transcript of the phone call. Was it a Corrupt Adam Schiff con? Why didn‚Äôt the IG see this? When do we depose Shifty Schiff to find out why he fraudulently made up my phone call and read this..
True! Without being stuck at an airport where CNN buys (at a big price) an uninterested audience they‚Äôve got nothing going. @CNN is BAD for America!

Great meeting with the @RepublicanStudy Committee this morning at the @WhiteHouse! 
With all my Administration has done on Legislative Approvals (broke Harry Truman‚Äôs Record) Regulation Cutting Judicial Appointments Building Military VA TAX CUTS &amp; REFORM Record Economy/Stock Market and so much more I am sure great credit will be given by mainstream news?
A different take! 
End the Democrats Obstruction! 
....Why would Kentucky ever think of giving up the most powerful position in Congress the Senate Majority Leader for a freshman Senator with little power in what will hopefully be the minority party. We need Mitch in the Senate to Keep America Great!!
...But while Dallas dropped to it knees as a team they ALL stood up for our National Anthem. Big progress being made - we love our country!
Praying for everyone in Florida. Hoping the hurricane dissipates but in any event please be careful.

There is no one better to represent the people of N.Y. and Staten Island (a place I know very well) than @RepDanDonovan who is strong on Borders &amp; Crime loves our Military &amp; our Vets voted for Tax Cuts and is helping me to Make America Great Again. Dan has my full endorsement!

We are on the losing side of almost all trade deals. Our friends and enemies have taken advantage of the U.S. for many years. Our Steel and Aluminum industries are dead. Sorry it‚Äôs time for a change! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
So professional of @ABC news to throw out the failing @UnionLeader newspaper from their debate. Paper won't survive highly unethical!
While all agree the U. S. President has the complete power to pardon why think of that when only crime so far is LEAKS against us.FAKE NEWS
Great new book "Resistance (At All Costs): How Trump Haters Are Breaking America" out by Kimberley Strassel of the Wall Street Journal. Kim has treated us fairly and for that I am very appreciative. Check it out today it is great!
Crazy Joe Biden is trying to act like a tough guy. Actually he is weak both mentally and physically and yet he threatens me for the second time with physical assault. He doesn‚Äôt know me but he would go down fast and hard crying all the way. Don‚Äôt threaten people Joe!
Thank you working hard! 
....We are getting other countries to reduce and eliminate tariffs and trade barriers that have been unfairly used for years against our farmers workers and companies. We are opening up closed markets and expanding our footprint. They must play fair or they will pay tariffs!
Our great financial team is in China trying to negotiate a level playing field on trade! I look forward to being with President Xi in the not too distant future. We will always have a good (great) relationship!

So we now find out that it was indeed the unverified and Fake Dirty Dossier that was paid for by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC that was knowingly &amp; falsely submitted to FISA and which was responsible for starting the totally conflicted and discredited Mueller Witch Hunt!
We need a tax system that is FAIR to working families &amp; that encourages companies to STAY in America GROW in America and HIRE in Americaüá∫üá∏ 
Obama has blocked ICE officers and BP from doing their jobs. That ends when I am President!
We must honor the sacred memory of those we have lost by acting as ONE PEOPLE. Open wounds cannot heal if we are divided. We must seek real bipartisan solutions that will truly make America safer and better for all. 
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no fairness here if you‚Äôre a Democrat or a friend of Hillary you get immunity or off scott free. If you‚Äôre connected to Donald Trump you get people like Robert Mueller &amp; Andrew Weissman and his team of partisans coming after you with a vengeance and abusing their....
Chinese President XI XINPING and I spoke at length about the meeting with KIM JONG UN of North Korea. President XI told me he appreciates that the U.S. is working to solve the problem diplomatically rather than going with the ominous alternative. China continues to be helpful!
....We will then spend (match or better) the money that China may no longer be spending with our Great Patriot Farmers (Agriculture) which is a small percentage of total Tariffs received and distribute the food to starving people in nations around the world! GREAT! #MAGA
The Fake News LameStream Media is doing everything possible the ‚Äúcreate‚Äù a U.S. recession even though the numbers &amp; facts are working totally in the opposite direction. They would be willing to hurt many people but that doesn‚Äôt matter to them. Our Economy is sooo strong sorry!
Badly failing presidential candidate @KamalaHarris will not go to a very wonderful largely African American event today because yesterday I recieved a major award at the same event for being able to produce &amp; sign into law major Criminal Justice Reform legislation which will..
...It is all a GIANT AND ILLEGAL HOAX developed long before the election itself but used as an excuse by the Democrats as to why Crooked Hillary Clinton lost the Election! Someday the Fake News Media will turn honest &amp; report that Donald J. Trump was actually a GREAT Candidate!
The Left has become totally unhinged. They no longer care what is Right for our Countrty!

Good luck to @Joy_Villa on her decision to enter the wonderful world of politics. She has many fans!
We need the Wall for the safety and security of our country. We need the Wall to help stop the massive inflow of drugs from Mexico now rated the number one most dangerous country in the world. If there is no Wall there is no Deal!

....just the large States - the Cities would end up running the Country. Smaller States &amp; the entire Midwest would end up losing all power - &amp; we can‚Äôt let that happen. I used to like the idea of the Popular Vote but now realize the Electoral College is far better for the U.S.A.
This is a great day for civilization. I am proud of the United States for sticking by me in following a necessary but somewhat unconventional path. People have been trying to make this ‚ÄúDeal‚Äù for many years. Millions of lives will be saved. Congratulations to ALL!
Thank you to Congressman Tom Reed of New York for your wonderful comments on our great new Trade Deal with Mexico and Canada the USMCA. I have long ago given you my Full Endorsement and for good reason. Keep up the Great Work! @Varneyco

Cruz just lied again- I am and have been totally against #ObamaCare- repeal and replace!
Report: There were no FISA hearings held over Spy documents.‚ÄùIt is astonishing that the FISA courts couldn‚Äôt hold hearings on Spy Warrants targeting Donald Trump. It isn‚Äôt about Carter Page it‚Äôs about the Trump Campaign. You‚Äôve got corruption at the DOJ &amp; FBI. The leadership....
....and one of the most highly respected lawyers and legal minds in the Country he will be a great addition to our team. I look forward to having him join our very successful Administration!
So now the Obama appointed judge on the Census case (Are you a Citizen of the United States?) won‚Äôt let the Justice Department use the lawyers  that it wants to use. Could this be a first?

Such a fantastic win for Ron DeSantis and the people of the Great State of Florida. Ron will be a fantastic Governor. On to November!
China is adding great stimulus to its economy while at the same time keeping interest rates low. Our Federal Reserve has incessantly lifted interest rates even though inflation is very low and instituted a very big dose of quantitative tightening. We have the potential to go...

I‚Äôve employed thousands of Electrical Workers. They will be voting for me!
So funny to see little Adam Schitt (D-CA) talking about the fact that Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker was not approved by the Senate but not mentioning the fact that Bob Mueller (who is highly conflicted) was not approved by the Senate!
....something that is so obviously the future. I want the United States to win through competition not by blocking out currently more advanced technologies. We must always be the leader in everything we do especially when it comes to the very exciting world of technology!

The White House will be hosting a very big and very important Social Media Summit today. Would I have become President without Social Media? Yes (probably)! At its conclusion we will all go to the beautiful Rose Garden for a News Conference on the Census and Citizenship.
So disgraceful that a person illegally in our country killed @Colts linebacker Edwin Jackson. This is just one of many such preventable tragedies. We must get the Dems to get tough on the Border and with illegal immigration FAST!
Heed the advice of @FLGovScott!"If you're in an evacuation zone you need to get to a shelter...there's not many hours left." Gov. Scott 
Some of the Fake News Media likes to say that I am not totally engaged in healthcare. Wrong I know the subject well &amp; want victory for U.S.

Agent Peter Strzok was just fired from the FBI - finally. The list of bad players in the FBI &amp; DOJ gets longer &amp; longer. Based on the fact that Strzok was in charge of the Witch Hunt will it be dropped? It is a total Hoax. No Collusion No Obstruction - I just fight back!
Look forward to being in Tampa this afternoon. Wonderful crowds. Thank you Florida!
.@DebbieStabenow voted against Tax Cuts great Healthcare Supreme Court Justices and all of the many things the people of Michigan wanted and need. She is an automatic far left vote controlled by her bosses. John James can be a truly great Senator!
Time Magazine called to say that I was PROBABLY going to be named ‚ÄúMan (Person) of the Year‚Äù like last year but I would have to agree to an interview and a major photo shoot. I said probably is no good and took a pass. Thanks anyway!

‚ÄúUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told reporters Thursday his controversial July call with President Trump involved no bribe blackmail or quid pro quo as impeachment-minded Democrats claim.‚Äù This should immediately end the talk of impeachment!

Peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused - life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?

Col. Jim Carafano on @IngrahamAngle ‚ÄúTrump has made the Middle East a better place. When Trump came into office ISIS was running amuck in the Middle East. Over a million refugees poured into Western Europe - none of that is happening today. That‚Äôs all due to Trump.‚Äù

Iran is failing at every level despite the terrible deal made with them by the Obama Administration. The great Iranian people have been repressed for many years. They are hungry for food &amp; for freedom. Along with human rights the wealth of Iran is being looted. TIME FOR CHANGE!

Hard to believe that @FoxNews is wasting airtime on Mayor Pete as Chris Wallace likes to call him. Fox is moving more and more to the losing (wrong) side in covering the Dems. They got dumped from the Democrats boring debates and they just want in. They forgot the people.....
She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see! 
The Failing New York Times criticized Secretary of State Pompeo for being AWOL (missing) when in fact he was flying to North Korea. Fake News so bad!
General Anthony Tata: ‚ÄúPresident Trump is a man of his word &amp; he said he was going to be tough on the Border and he is tough on the Border. He has rightfully strengthened the Border in the face of an unprecedented threat. It‚Äôs the right move by President Trump.‚Äù Thanks General!
Will be going to Iowa tonight for Rally and more! The Farmers (and all) are very happy with USMCA!
Leaving for Albany New York now massive crowd expected. Very exciting!
I am glad that my friend @EmmanuelMacron and the protestors in Paris have agreed with the conclusion I reached two years ago. The Paris Agreement is fatally flawed because it raises the price of energy for responsible countries while whitewashing some of the worst polluters....
Happy Birthday @DonaldJTrumpJr!
My deepest condolences to the victims of the terrible shooting in Douglas County @DCSheriff and their families. We love our police and law enforcement - God Bless them all! #LESM

‚ÄúHe (President Trump) didn‚Äôt specifically mention the explicit quid pro quo of‚Ä¶unless you investigate this‚Ä¶we‚Äôre going to withhold military aid to you.‚Äù Pamela Brown
Great fun and meeting with Prime Minister @AbeShinzo. Numerous Japanese officials told me that the Democrats would rather see the United States fail than see me or the Republican Party succeed - Death Wish!
It‚Äôs the Democrats fault they won‚Äôt give us the votes needed to pass good immigration legislation. They want open borders which breeds horrible crime. Republicans want security. But I am working on something - it never ends!
Great financial numbers being announced on an almost daily basis. Economy has never been better jobs at best point in history. Fixing our terrible Trade Deals is a priority-and going very well. Immigration on Merit Based System to take care of the companies coming back to U.S.A.
Keep up the great work - THANK YOU! 
Tariffs will bring in FAR MORE wealth to our Country than even a phenomenal deal of the traditional kind. Also much easier &amp; quicker to do. Our Farmers will do better faster and starving nations can now be helped. Waivers on some products will be granted or go to new source!
The Republican Party had a great night. Tremendous voter energy and excitement and all candidates are those who have a great chance of winning in November. The Economy is sooo strong and with Nancy Pelosi wanting to end the big Tax Cuts and Raise Taxes why wouldn‚Äôt we win?
‚ÄúBruce Ohr of DOJ is in legal jeopardy it‚Äôs astonishing that he‚Äôs still employed. Bruce &amp; Nelly Ohr‚Äôs bank account is getting fatter &amp; fatter because of the Dossier that they are both peddling. He doesn‚Äôt disclose it under Fed Regs. Using your Federal office for personal.......
....should be shut down. The Strzok firing shows that the fundamental underpinnings of the investigation were corrupt. It should be shut down by the courts or by honest prosecutors.‚Äù Thank you Judicial Watch I couldn‚Äôt have said it better myself!
....terrible thing to watch especially when things could be taken care of sooo easily. We will WIN anyway but it would be much easier if the Fed understood which they don‚Äôt that we are competing against other countries all of whom want to do well at our expense!
...the Crown Prince. He is waiting for the results of the investigations being done by the Saudis and Turkey and just gave a news conference to that effect.
If schools are mandated to be gun free zones violence and danger are given an open invitation to enter. Almost all school shootings are in gun free zones. Cowards will only go where there is no deterrent!
Despite the tremendous success that I have had as President including perhaps the greatest ECONOMY and most successful first two years of any President in history they have stolen two years of my (our) Presidency (Collusion Delusion) that we will never be able to get back.....
WITCH HUNT!
Congratulations to Mike Dewine on his big win in the Great State of Ohio. He will be a great Governor with a heavy focus on HealthCare and Jobs.  His Socialist opponent in November should not do well a big failure in last job!
Just met with UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres who is working hard to ‚ÄúMake the United Nations Great Again.‚Äù When the UN does more to solve conflicts around the world it means the U.S. has less to do and we save money. @NikkiHaley is doing a fantastic job! 
Good news House just passed #KatesLaw. Hopefully Senate will follow.
After many years (decades) Mexico is apprehending large numbers of people at their Southern Border mostly from Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador. They have ALL been taking U.S. money for years and doing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for us just like the Democrats in Congress!

"Under Trump gains against #ISIS have dramatically accelerated"
These politicians like Cruz and Graham who have watched ISIS and many other problems develop for years do nothing to make things better!
Congratulations Great Show! 
....However out of respect for the Bush Family and former President George H.W. Bush we will wait until after the funeral to have a press conference.

Will CNN send its cameras to the border to show the massive unreported crisis now unfolding -- or are they worried it will hurt Hillary?
This is the real corruption that the Fake News Media refuses to even acknowledge! 
The trip by @VP Pence was long planned. He is receiving great praise for leaving game after the players showed such disrespect for country!
SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS TRUMP TRAVEL BAN. Wow!
Courts &amp; Dems in Congress neither of which have a clue are trying to FORCE migrants into our Country! OUR COUNTRY IS FULL OUR DETENTION CENTERS HOSPITALS &amp; SCHOOLS ARE PACKED. Crazy!
Heading back to D.C. Many great things are happening for our Country!
The Fake News Media wants to stay as far away as possible from the Ukraine and China deals made by the Bidens. A Corrupt Media is so bad for our Country! In actuality the Media may be even more Corrupt than the Bidens which is hard to do!
We are one nation. When one state hurts we all hurt. We must all work together - to lift each other up. 
It never ends. The Do Nothing Dems are terrible! 
We are going to demand Congress secure the border in the upcoming CR. Illegal immigration must end!
LONDON needs a new mayor ASAP. Khan is a disaster - will only get worse!

...Time will tell what will happen with North Korea but at the end of the previous administration relationship was horrendous and very bad things were about to happen. Now a whole different story. I look forward to seeing Kim Jong Un shortly. Progress being made-big difference!
‚ÄúThe speed bump has been missteps by the Federal Reserve.‚Äù @cvpayne  @foxandfriends  So true!
ATTN: @HillaryClinton - Why did five of your staffers need FBI IMMUNITY?! #BigLeagueTruth #Debates
I think it is very important for the Democrats to press forward with their Green New Deal. It would be great for the so-called ‚ÄúCarbon Footprint‚Äù to permanently eliminate all Planes Cars Cows Oil Gas &amp; the Military - even if no other country would do the same. Brilliant!
Experts stated that the Fed should not have tightened and then waited too long to undo their mistake. James Bullard of St. Louis Fed said they waited too long to correct the mistake that they made last December. ‚ÄúMistake Powell cut rate and then he started talking.‚Äù @LouDobbs
The Intelligence people seem to be extremely passive and naive when it comes to the dangers of Iran. They are wrong! When I became President Iran was making trouble all over the Middle East and beyond. Since ending the terrible Iran Nuclear Deal they are MUCH different but....

Great going Daniel proud of you! 
Thank you Ivanka. Really Amazing! 
...really bad things. Nasty to people &amp; would constantly miss meetings &amp; work. When Gen. Kelly came on board he told me she was a loser &amp; nothing but problems. I told him to try working it out if possible because she only said GREAT things about me - until she got fired!
Continuing to monitor the heartbreaking bridge collapse at FIU - so tragic. Many brave First Responders rushed in to save lives. Thank you for your courage. Praying this evening for all who are affected.

California now wants to scale back their already failed ‚Äúfast train‚Äù project by substantially shortening the distance so that it no longer goes from L.A. to San Francisco. A different deal and record cost overruns. Send the Federal Government back the Billions of Dollars WASTED!

Spoke with @GovStitt of Oklahoma last night from Japan because of the devastating tornadoes. Told him that @FEMA and the federal government are fully behind him and the great people of Oklahoma.
Our Border Control Agents have done an incredible job under very adverse conditions. I am very proud to have increased their salaries because of the great job they do. Nobody deserves it more. THANK YOU and keep up the outstanding work! 
It was wonderful to have President Petro Poroshenko of Ukraine with us in New York City today. #UNGAüé•

The Democrats are getting ZERO work done in Congress. All they are focused on is trying to prove the Mueller Report wrong the Witch Hunt!
Because we have done so well with Energy over the last few years (thank you Mr. President!) we are a net Energy Exporter &amp; now the Number One Energy Producer in the World. We don‚Äôt need Middle Eastern Oil &amp; Gas &amp; in fact have very few tankers there but will help our Allies!
Wow @foxandfriends is blowing away the competition in the morning ratings. Morning Joe is a dead show with very few people watching and sadly Fake News CNN is also doing poorly. Too much hate and inaccurately reported stories - too predictable!
Great job by Michael Anton on @foxandfriends. A true National Security expert!
The Phony Witch Hunt continues but Mueller and his gang of Angry Dems are only looking at one side not the other. Wait until it comes out how horribly &amp; viciously they are treating people ruining lives for them refusing to lie. Mueller is a conflicted prosecutor gone rogue....
President Bashar al-Assad of Syria must not recklessly attack Idlib Province. The Russians and Iranians would be making a grave humanitarian mistake to take part in this potential human tragedy. Hundreds of thousands of people could be killed. Don‚Äôt let that happen!

Jens Stoltenberg NATO Secretary General just stated that because of me NATO has been able to raise far more money than ever before from its members after many years of decline. It‚Äôs called burden sharing. Also more united. Dems &amp; Fake News like to portray the opposite!

BUILD A WALL &amp; CRIME WILL FALL! 
...The problem is no matter what the Radical Left Democrats get no matter what we give them it will never be enough. Just watch they will Harass &amp; Complain &amp; Resist (the theme of their movement). So maybe we should just take our victory and say NO we‚Äôve got a Country to run!

Brett Kavanaugh should start suing people for liable or the Justice Department should come to his rescue. The lies being told about him are unbelievable. False Accusations without recrimination. When does it stop? They are trying to influence his opinions. Can‚Äôt let that happen!
An honor to host the Annual @WhiteHouse Easter Egg Roll! 
Will be calling the President of Egypt in a short while to discuss the tragic terrorist attack with so much loss of life. We have to get TOUGHER AND SMARTER than ever before and we will. Need the WALL need the BAN! God bless the people of Egypt.
Big story out that the FBI ignored tens of thousands of Crooked Hillary Emails many of which are REALLY BAD. Also gave false election info. I feel sure that we will soon be getting to the bottom of all of this corruption. At some point I may have to get involved!
My thoughts and prayers are with the two police officers their families and everybody at the @WestervillePD. 
Just put out a very important policy statement on the extraordinary influx of hatred &amp; danger coming into our country. We must be vigilant!
I don‚Äôt believe the Democrats really want to see a deal on DACA. They are all talk and no action. This is the time but day by day they are blowing the one great opportunity they have. Too bad!
The economy cannot take four more years of these same failed policies.#BigLeagueTruth #DrainTheSwamp 
Do you remember two years ago when Iraq was going to fight the Kurds in a different part of Syria. Many people wanted us to fight with the Kurds against Iraq who we just fought for. I said no and the Kurds left the fight twice. Now the same thing is happening with Turkey......
Never seen the Republican Party so unified. No ‚ÄúCave‚Äù on the issue of Border and National Security. A beautiful thing to see especially when you hear the new rhetoric spewing from the mouths of the Democrats who talk Open Border High Taxes and Crime. Stop Criminals &amp; Drugs now!
James Comey‚Äôs behind closed doors testimony reveals that ‚Äúthere was not evidence of Campaign Collusion‚Äù with Russia when he left the FBI. In other words the Witch Hunt is illegal and should never have been started!
Spoke to my two good friends Prime Minister Modi of India and Prime Minister Khan of Pakistan regarding Trade Strategic Partnerships and most importantly for India and Pakistan to work towards reducing tensions in Kashmir. A tough situation but good conversations!

Wow just revealed that Michael Cohen wrote a ‚Äúlove letter to Trump‚Äù manuscript for a new book that he was pushing. Written and submitted long after Charlottesville and Helsinki his phony reasons for going rogue. Book is exact opposite of his fake testimony which now is a lie!
Shifty Adam Schiff will only release doctored transcripts. We haven‚Äôt even seen the documents and are restricted from (get this) having a lawyer. Republicans should put out their own transcripts! Schiff must testify as to why he MADE UP a statement from me and read it to all!

On Trade France makes excellent wine but so does the U.S. The problem is that France makes it very hard for the U.S. to sell its wines into France and charges big Tariffs whereas the U.S. makes it easy for French wines and charges very small Tariffs. Not fair must change!
The only problem our economy has is the Fed. They don‚Äôt have a feel for the Market they don‚Äôt understand necessary Trade Wars or Strong Dollars or even Democrat Shutdowns over Borders. The Fed is like a powerful golfer who can‚Äôt score because he has no touch - he can‚Äôt putt!

There was No Collusion with Russia (except by the Democrats). When will this very expensive Witch Hunt Hoax ever end? So bad for our Country. Is the Special Counsel/Justice Department leaking my lawyers letters to the Fake News Media? Should be looking at Dems corruption instead?
At the request of many I will be reviewing the case of a ‚ÄúU.S. Military hero‚Äù Major Matt Golsteyn who is charged with murder. He could face the death penalty from our own government after he admitted to killing a Terrorist bomb maker while overseas. @PeteHegseth @FoxNews

For years even as a "civilian" I listened as Republicans pushed the Repeal and Replace of ObamaCare. Now they finally have their chance!
These crimes won't be happening if I'm elected POTUS. Killer should have never been here. #AmericaFirst 
The United States Treasury has taken in MANY billions of dollars from the Tariffs we are charging China and other countries that have not treated us fairly. In the meantime we are doing well in various Trade Negotiations currently going on. At some point this had to be done!

Great interview of Ron Vitiello Former Acting Ice Director by @JesseBWatters on @FoxNews about all of the work that is being (&amp; has been) done on our Southern Border. Thanks Ron terrific job! Now if only the Democrats would fix the Loopholes &amp; Asylum.
The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime. It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign. WITCH HUNT!

The Paris Agreement isn‚Äôt working out so well for Paris. Protests and riots all over France. People do not want to pay large sums of money much to third world countries (that are questionably run) in order to maybe protect the environment. Chanting ‚ÄúWe Want Trump!‚Äù Love France.

Unbelievably James Comey states that Polls where Crooked Hillary was leading were a factor in the handling (stupidly) of the Clinton Email probe. In other words he was making decisions based on the fact that he thought she was going to win and he wanted a job. Slimeball!

Anytime you hear a Democrat saying that you can have good Border Security without a Wall write them off as just another politician following the party line. Time for us to save billions of dollars a year and have at the same time far greater safety and control!

The problem with banker Jamie Dimon running for President is that he doesn‚Äôt have the aptitude or ‚Äúsmarts‚Äù &amp; is a poor public speaker &amp; nervous mess - otherwise he is wonderful. I‚Äôve made a lot of bankers and others look much smarter than they are with my great economic policy!

Weak JEB getting thrown out by management during speech. Do you think he will be this tough on Putin &amp; others?  
Such a serious problem for Ted &amp; the GOP. Great doubt Dems will sue! Let's all work together to solve this problem. 
Again the story that there was collusion between the Russians &amp; Trump campaign was fabricated by Dems as an excuse for losing the election.
What about all of the contact with the Clinton campaign and the Russians? Also is it true that the DNC would not let the FBI in to look?
The Wall is being built after victories against the Democrats in various courts! 

‚ÄúMillions of Americans will see what a partisan sham this whole thing is.‚Äù Rush Limbaugh @foxandfriends  Also why is corrupt politician Schiff allowed to hand over cross examination to a high priced outside lawyer. Did that lawyer ever work for me which would be a conflict?
DOJ just issued the McCabe report - which is a total disaster. He LIED! LIED! LIED! McCabe was totally controlled by Comey - McCabe is Comey!! No collusion all made up by this den of thieves and lowlifes!
If @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan and Raul_Labrador would get on board we would have both great healthcare and massive tax cuts &amp; reform.
Gave an OFF THE RECORD luncheon somewhat of a White House tradition or custom to network anchors yesterday - and they quickly leaked the contents of the meeting. Who would believe how bad it has gotten with the mainstream media which has gone totally bonkers!
Fines and penalties against Wells Fargo Bank for their bad acts against their customers and others will not be dropped as has incorrectly been reported but will be pursued and if anything substantially increased. I will cut Regs but make penalties severe when caught cheating!
Big Supreme Court ruling for Baker just out!
As most people are aware according to the Polls I won EVERY debate including the three with Crooked Hillary Clinton despite the fact that in the first debate they modulated the sound on me and got caught. This crew looks somewhat easier than Crooked but you never know?

Rep Elijah Cummings has been a brutal bully shouting and screaming at the great men &amp; women of Border Patrol about conditions at the Southern Border when actually his Baltimore district is FAR WORSE and more dangerous. His district is considered the Worst in the USA......
Our economy is better than it has been in many decades. Businesses are coming back to America like never before. Chrysler as an example is leaving Mexico and coming back to the USA. Unemployment is nearing record lows. We are on the right track!
The Border Committee Democrats are behaving all of a sudden irrationally. Not only are they unwilling to give dollars for the obviously needed Wall (they overrode recommendations of Border Patrol experts) but they don‚Äôt even want to take muderers into custody! What‚Äôs going on?

Very little discussion of all the purposely false and defamatory stories put out this week by the Fake News Media. They are out of control - correct reporting means nothing to them. Major lies written then forced to be withdrawn after they are exposed...a stain on America!

Peter Strzok worked as the leader of the Rigged Witch Hunt for a long period of time - he got it started and was only fired because the gig was up. But remember he took his orders from Comey and McCabe and they took their orders from you know who. Mueller/Comey best friends!
How can Ted Cruz be an Evangelical Christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest?
The IG Report is a total disaster for Comey his minions and sadly the FBI. Comey will now officially go down as the worst leader by far in the history of the FBI. I did a great service to the people in firing him. Good Instincts. Christopher Wray will bring it proudly back!

The @USNavy‚Äôs first female Admiral Alene Duerk once said: ‚ÄúIt was a nice distinction to have and to be recognized as the first but I wanted to make certain that I used that notoriety to do as much positive as I could.‚Äù Alene did just that and America is forever grateful! 
Maggie Haberman of the Failing @nytimes reported that I was annoyed by the lack of cameras inside the hospitals in Dayton &amp; El Paso when in fact I was the one who stated very strongly that I didn‚Äôt want the Fake News inside &amp; told my people NOT to let them in. Fake reporting!
I never said anything bad about Andrew McCabe‚Äôs wife other than she (they) should not have taken large amounts of campaign money from a Crooked Hillary source when Clinton was under investigation by the FBI. I never called his wife a loser to him (another McCabe made up lie)!

Thoughts and prayers to all of those affected by the shooting at the Synagogue in Poway California. God bless you all. Suspect apprehended. Law enforcement did outstanding job. Thank you!
A great place! 
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was never given or shown a Transcript or Video of the Saudi Consulate event. FAKE NEWS!
I would be willing to ‚Äúshut down‚Äù government if the Democrats do not give us the votes for Border Security which includes the Wall! Must get rid of Lottery Catch &amp; Release etc. and finally go to system of Immigration based on MERIT! We need great people coming into our Country!
WOW John James is making headway in Michigan. We are bringing jobs back to the State and the People of Michigan appreciate it. Debbie Stabenow has been no help if anything a major hindrance. John James is a star I hope the voters see it. Polls are tightening!
POLLING LOCATIONS: 
Congratulations to my good friend Prime Minister @AbeShinzo on his HUGE election victory in Japan. I‚Äôm looking forward to many more years of working together. See you in New York next week!üá∫üá∏üáØüáµ
Next Saturday night I will be holding a BIG rally in Pennsylvania. Look forward to it!
President Obama &amp; Putin fail to reach deal on Syria - so what else is new? Obama is not a natural deal maker. Only makes bad deals!
My deepest sympathies go out to the family and friends of great businessman and energy expert Chris Cline his wonderful daughter Kameron and their friends on the tragic accident which took place in the Bahamas. The great people of West Virginia will never forget them!
Chris Farrell Judicial Watch. ‚ÄúThey were running an operation to undermine a candidate for President of the U.S. These are all violations of law. This is intelligence tradecraft to steer an election. There‚Äôs nothing more grave when it comes to abuse of our intelligence system...

‚ÄúHis is turning out to be an enormously consequential presidency. So much so that despite my own frustration over his missteps there has never been a day when I wished Hillary Clinton were president. Not one. Indeed as Trump‚Äôs accomplishments accumulate the mere thought of...
Thank you Ohio! #AmericaFirst 
Is it really possible that Bruce Ohr whose wife Nellie was paid by Simpson and GPS Fusion for work done on the Fake Dossier and who was used as a Pawn in this whole SCAM (WITCH HUNT) is still working for the Department of Justice????? Can this really be so?????
....The conversation with the new and very good Ukraine President who told the Fake News at the United Nations that HE WAS NOT PRESSURED BY ME IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM should by and of itself bring an end to the new and most recent Witch Hunt. Others ended in ashes!
Spoke today with Venezuelan Interim President Juan Guaido to congratulate him on his historic assumption of the presidency and reinforced strong United States support for Venezuela‚Äôs fight to regain its democracy....
Bob Corker who helped President O give us the bad Iran Deal &amp; couldn't get elected dog catcher in Tennessee is now fighting Tax Cuts....
Hillary Clinton will use American tax dollars to provide amnesty for thousands of illegals. I will put‚Ä¶ 
Does anyone notice how the Montana Congressional race was such a big deal to Dems &amp; Fake News until the Republican won? V was poorly covered
....the number of people who are no longer looking for jobs but who are now seeing the opportunity for job growth you‚Äôve got to give the President an A Plus for that.‚Äù  Thank you Robert one of our great business leaders!
Thanks to the historic TAX CUTS that I signed into law your paychecks are going way UP your taxes are going way DOWN and America is once again OPEN FOR BUSINESS! 
I don‚Äôt think the Dems on the Border Committee are being allowed by their leaders to make a deal. They are offering very little money for the desperately needed Border Wall &amp; now out of the blue want a cap on convicted violent felons to be held in detention!
Hurricane on its way to the Florida Pan Handle with major elements arriving tomorrow. Could also hit in later stage parts of Georgia and unfortunately North Carolina and South Carolina again...
Looking like our great South Carolina could get hit MUCH harder than first thought. Georgia and North Carolina also. It‚Äôs moving around and very hard to predict except that it is one of the biggest and strongest (and really wide) that we have seen in decades. Be safe!
The Democrats in the Southwest part of Virginia have been abandoned by their Party. Republican Ed Gillespie will never let you down!
üá∫üá∏üá¶üá∫ 
Wow! Big VICTORY on the Wall. The United States Supreme Court overturns lower court injunction allows Southern Border Wall to proceed. Big WIN for Border Security and the Rule of Law!
Big attacks on Republicans and Conservatives by Social Media. Not good!
Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words.
The Stock Market has been creating tremendous benefits for our country in the form of not only Record Setting Stock Prices but present and future Jobs Jobs Jobs. Seven TRILLION dollars of value created since our big election win!
After witnessing first hand the horror &amp; devastation caused by Hurricane Harveymy heart goes out even more so to the great people of Texas!
THE CHOICE IS CLEAR!#BigLeagueTruth #DrainTheSwamp 
Thank you New Hampshire! Great people -- see you next week! 
The Obstructionist Democrats make Security for our country very difficult. They use the courts and associated delay at all times. Must stop!
When there is not an underlying crime with regard to Collusion (in fact the whole thing was a made up fraud) it is difficult to say that someone is obstructing something. There was no underlying crime.‚Äù @marthamaccallum  @FoxNews
Rex Tillerson never threatened to resign. This is Fake News put out by @NBCNews. Low news and reporting standards. No verification from me.
I hope the Fake News Media keeps talking about Wacky Congresswoman Wilson in that she as a representative is killing the Democrat Party!
As Corey Lewandowski stated very clearly yesterday in front of the House Judiciary Committee President Trump didn‚Äôt do anything wrong or illegal. But they all know that. The Democrats are hurting our Country and getting nothing done. Shameful! @CLewandowski_  @foxandfriends
Thank you! 
....it‚Äôs powerful common sense Immigration Laws to stop illegals from coming through Mexico into the U.S. and removing them back to their country of origin. Until Mexico cleans up this ridiculous &amp; massive migration we will be focusing on Border Security not Ports of Entry....
Thank you Maine New Hampshire and Iowa. The waiting is OVER! The time for change is NOW! We are going to‚Ä¶ 
Some members of the media are very Angry at the Fake Story in the New York Times. They actually called to complain and apologize - a big step forward. From the day I announced the Times has been Fake News and with their disgusting new Board Member it will only get worse!
....Ever since Andrew came to my office to ask that I appoint him to the U.S. Supreme Court and I said NO he has been very hostile! Also asked for pardon for his friend. A good ‚Äúpal‚Äù of low ratings Shepard Smith.
Thank you @FrankLuntz  
The big Caravan of People from Honduras now coming across Mexico and heading to our ‚ÄúWeak Laws‚Äù Border had better be stopped before it gets there. Cash cow NAFTA is in play as is foreign aid to Honduras and the countries that allow this to happen. Congress MUST ACT NOW!
A great day at the White House!
I hope our great Republican Senators don‚Äôt get led down the path of weak and ineffective Border Security. Without strong Borders we don‚Äôt have a Country - and the voters are on board with us. Be strong and smart don‚Äôt fall into the Democrats ‚Äútrap‚Äù of Open Borders and Crime!
Today @FLOTUS hosted a Military Mother's Day Event in the East Room of the WH. It was an honor to stop by say hel‚Ä¶ 
Just spoke with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia who totally denied any knowledge of what took place in their Turkish Consulate. He was with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo...
Mario Draghi just announced more stimulus could come which immediately dropped the Euro against the Dollar making it unfairly easier for them to compete against the USA. They have been getting away with this for years along with China and others.
WOW - THANK YOU TENNESSEE! 
....IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY! We went to war under a false &amp; now disproven premise WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. There were NONE! Now we are slowly &amp; carefully bringing our great soldiers &amp; military home. Our focus is on the BIG PICTURE! THE USA IS GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE!
Remember it was Buzzfeed that released the totally discredited ‚ÄúDossier‚Äù paid for by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the Democrats (as opposition research) on which the entire Russian probe is based! A very sad day for journalism but a great day for our Country!
‚ÄúThe recusal of Jeff Sessions was an unforced betrayal of the President of the United States.‚Äù JOE DIGENOVA former U.S. Attorney.

How can the Rigged Witch Hunt proceed when it was started influenced and worked on for an extended period of time by former FBI Agent/Lover Peter Strzok? Read his hate filled and totally biased Emails and the answer is clear!
Adam should be Impeached!

Fantastic numbers on consumer spending released on Friday. Stock Market hits all time high!
Thank you for all of the compliments on getting the World Cup to come to the U.S.A. Mexico and Canada. I worked hard on this along with a Great Team of talented people. We never fail and it will be a great World Cup! A special thanks to Bob Kraft for excellent advice.

Congratulations @ElonMusk and @SpaceX on the successful #FalconHeavy launch. This achievement along with @NASA‚Äôs commercial and international partners continues to show American ingenuity at its best! 
Many people are now saying that this is the worst storm/hurricane they have ever seen. Good news is that we have great talent on the ground.
Obamacare is a disaster - as I've been saying from the beginning. Time to repeal &amp; replace! #ObamacareFail 
More text messages between former FBI employees Peter Strzok and Lisa Page are a disaster and embarrassment to the FBI &amp; DOJ. This should never have happened but we are learning more and more by the hour. ‚ÄúOthers were leaking like mad‚Äù in order to get the President! ........
I have met &amp; spent a lot of time with families @ The Remembrance Project. I will fight for them everyday!‚Ä¶ 
That's right we need a TRAVEL BAN for certain DANGEROUS countries not some politically correct term that won't help us protect our people!
Despite the constant negative press covfefe
Is Robert Mueller ever going to release his conflicts of interest with respect to President Trump including the fact that we had a very nasty &amp; contentious business relationship I turned him down to head the FBI (one day before appointment as S.C.) &amp; Comey is his close friend..
‚ÄúVery concerned about Comey‚Äôs firing afraid they will be exposed‚Äù said Bruce Ohr. DOJ‚Äôs Emails &amp; Notes show Bruce Ohr‚Äôs connection to (phony &amp; discredited) Trump Dossier. A creep thinking he would get caught in a dishonest act. Rigged Witch Hunt!
....for the Middle Class. The House and Senate should consider ASAP as the process of final approval moves along. Push Biggest Tax Cuts EVER

#AutismAwarenessDay #LightItUpBlue 
As has been incorrectly reported by the Fake News Media I never told then White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire Robert Mueller even though I had the legal right to do so. If I wanted to fire Mueller I didn‚Äôt need McGahn to do it I could have done it myself. Nevertheless....
We are sealing up our Southern Border. The people of our great country want Safety and Security. The Dems have been a disaster on this very important issue!
The Economy is strong and good whereas the rest of the world is not doing so well. Despite this the Fake News Media together with their Partner the Democrat Party are working overtime to convince people that we are in or will soon be going into a Recession. They are.....
‚ÄúWe the people will now be subjected to the biggest display of modern day McCathyism....which is the widest fishing net expedition....every aspect of the presidents life....all in order to get power back so they can institute Socialism.‚Äù @seanhannity

The Trump Administration is revoking California‚Äôs Federal Waiver on emissions in order to produce far less expensive cars for the consumer while at the same time making the cars substantially SAFER. This will lead to more production because of this pricing and safety......
.@foxandfriends will be showing much of our successful trip to Asia and the friendships &amp; benefits that will endure for years to come!
This month we celebrate the contributions of Asian Americans &amp; Pacific Islanders that enrich our Nation. 
..Breaking News: The Ukrainian Government just said they weren‚Äôt pressured at all during the ‚Äúnice‚Äù call. Sleepy Joe Biden on the other hand forced a tough prosecutor out from investigating his son‚Äôs company by threat of not giving big dollars to Ukraine. That‚Äôs the real story!
THE DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO DESTROY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND ALL THAT IT STANDS FOR. STICK TOGETHER PLAY THEIR GAME AND FIGHT HARD REPUBLICANS. OUR COUNTRY IS AT STAKE!
A Harley-Davidson should never be built in another country-never! Their employees and customers are already very angry at them. If they move watch it will be the beginning of the end - they surrendered they quit! The Aura will be gone and they will be taxed like never before!
Will be going to North Dakota today to discuss tax reform and tax cuts. We are the highest taxed nation in the world - that will change.
Fake News just like the snakes and gators in the moat. The Media is deranged they have lost their minds! 

If we can help little #CharlieGard as per our friends in the U.K. and the Pope we would be delighted to do so.
BUILD A WALL &amp; CRIME WILL FALL! This is the new theme for two years until the Wall is finished (under construction now) of the Republican Party. Use it and pray!
I will be looking into this! #StopTheBias 
Thank you! #VoteTrump #ImWithYou 
It is our sacred duty to support America‚Äôs Service Members every single day they wear the uniform ‚Äì and every day after when they return home as Veterans. Together we will HONOR those who defend us we will CHERISH those who protect us and we will celebrate the amazing heroes... 
Massive amounts of money from China and other parts of the world is pouring into the United States for reasons of safety investment and interest rates! We are in a very strong position. Companies are also coming to the U.S. in big numbers. A beautiful thing to watch!

We join families of Kevin King &amp; Tim Weeks in celebrating their release from Taliban captivity. Thanks to President Ghani for his courageous support. Let‚Äôs hope this leads to more good things on the peace front like a ceasefire that will help end this long war. Proud of my team!
The Failing New York Times in one of the most devastating portrayals of bad journalism in history got caught by a leaker that they are shifting  from their Phony Russian Collusion Narrative (the Mueller Report &amp; his testimony were a total disaster) to a Racism Witch Hunt.....
So sad to see the Terror Attack in Paris. At some point countries will have to open their eyes &amp; see what is really going on. This kind of sickness &amp; hatred is not compatible with a loving peaceful &amp; successful country! Changes to our thought process on terror must be made.
There was NO DEAL made with Turkey for the release and return of Pastor Andrew Brunson. I don‚Äôt make deals for hostages. There was however great appreciation on behalf of the United States which will lead to good perhaps great relations between the United States &amp; Turkey!
Stock Market hit another all-time high yesterday - despite the Russian hoax story! Also jobs numbers are starting to look very good!
Massive sections of The Wall are being built at our Southern Border. It is going up rapidly and built to the highest standards and specifications of the Border Patrol experts. It is actually an amazing structure! Our U.S. Military is doing a GREAT job.
We shouldn‚Äôt be hiring judges by the thousands as our ridiculous immigration laws demand we should be changing our laws building the Wall hire Border Agents and Ice and not let people come into our country based on the legal phrase they are told to say as their password.
Megan King who is running for Superior Court Judge in the Pennsylvania election has my Full and Total Endorsement. She is tough on crime and fully understands all aspects of the law. Vote for Megan tomorrow (Tuesday).
Thank you Faith and Freedom Forum &amp; @UrbandaleSchool. I had a great time in Iowa today! 
I promise to rebuild our military and secure our border. Democrats want to shut down the government. Politics!
There is no political necessity to keep Canada in the new NAFTA deal. If we don‚Äôt make a fair deal for the U.S. after decade of abuse Canada will be out. Congress should not interfere with these negotiations or I will simply terminate NAFTA entirely &amp; we will be far better off..

We will be doing a major Counter Report to the Mueller Report. This should never again be allowed to happen to a future President of the United States!
Thank you Hugh! 
Thank you Florida Ohio and Pennsylvania! #CrookedHillary is not qualified. #ImWithYou 
Agreed! 
They let Crooked &amp; the Gang off the hook for the crime but it looks like the cover-up is just as bad. Unbelievable! 
Democrats are holding our Military hostage over their desire to have unchecked illegal immigration. Can‚Äôt let that happen!
‚ÄúThe best economy in our lifetime!‚Äù @IngrahamAngle
....you would get it by building or even buying. You always wanted to show losses for tax purposes....almost all real estate developers did - and often re-negotiate with banks it was sport. Additionally the very old information put out is a highly inaccurate Fake News hit job!
The Woodward book is a scam. I don‚Äôt talk the way I am quoted. If I did I would not have been elected President. These quotes were made up. The author uses every trick in the book to demean and belittle. I wish the people could see the real facts - and our country is doing GREAT!

Will Bruce Ohr whose family received big money for helping to create the phony dirty and discredited Dossier ever be fired from the Jeff Sessions  ‚ÄúJustice‚Äù Department? A total joke!

All Trump Haters and Lovers must watch. Thank you Steve Hilton! 
The Fake News Washington Post and even more Fake News New York Times are writing stories that there is infighting with respect to my strong policy in the Middle East. There is no infighting whatsoever....

The ‚ÄúSquad‚Äù is a very Racist group of troublemakers who are young inexperienced and not very smart. They are pulling the once great Democrat Party far left and were against humanitarian aid at the Border...And are now against ICE and Homeland Security. So bad for our Country!

To the great people of West Virginia we have together a really great chance to keep making a big difference. Problem is Don Blankenship currently running for Senate can‚Äôt win the General Election in your State...No way! Remember Alabama. Vote Rep. Jenkins or A.G. Morrisey!
WHAT THEY ARE SAYING ABOUT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN‚ÄôS ANTI-CATHOLIC BIGOTRY:

Paul Ryan should be focusing on holding the Majority rather than giving his opinions on Birthright Citizenship something he knows nothing about! Our new Republican Majority will work on this Closing the Immigration Loopholes and Securing our Border!
The only way to stop drugs gangs human trafficking criminal elements and much else from coming into our Country is with a Wall or Barrier. Drones and all of the rest are wonderful and lots of fun but it is only a good old fashioned Wall that works!
.....again with China as our relationship with them continues to be a very good one. The quality of the transaction is far more important to me than speed. I am in no hurry but things look very good! Their will be no reduction in the Tariffs currently being charged to China.
Great job done by @GovRonDesantis @SenRickScott Senator @MarcoRubio and all of the those from Florida that were so brilliantly involved including @FEMA @USCG Law Enforcement and First Responders. Thank you all!

....Iran‚Äôs very ignorant and insulting statement put out today only shows that they do not understand reality. Any attack by Iran on anything American will be met with great and overwhelming force. In some areas overwhelming will mean obliteration. No more John Kerry &amp; Obama!
The President of Ukraine said that he was NOT pressured by me to do anything wrong. Can‚Äôt have better testimony than that! As V.P. Biden had his son on the other hand take out millions of dollars by strong arming the Ukrainian President. Also looted millions from China. Bad!
A year ago the pundits &amp; talking heads people that couldn‚Äôt do the job before were begging for conciliation and peace - ‚Äúplease meet don‚Äôt go to war.‚Äù Now that we meet and have a great relationship with Kim Jong Un the same haters shout out ‚Äúyou shouldn‚Äôt meet do not meet!‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat happened is that Donald Trump won. Down goes Comey.‚Äù @foxandfriends

The Wall Street Journal stated falsely that I said to them ‚ÄúI have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un‚Äù (of N. Korea). Obviously I didn‚Äôt say that. I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôd have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un‚Äù a big difference. Fortunately we now record conversations with reporters...
Just revealed that the Failing and Desperate New York Times was feeding false stories about me &amp; those associated with me to the FBI. This shows the kind of unprecedented hatred I have been putting up with for years with this Crooked newspaper. Is what they have done legal?...
Crazy Maxine Waters said by some to be one of the most corrupt people in politics is rapidly becoming together with Nancy Pelosi the FACE of the Democrat Party. Her ranting and raving even referring to herself as a wounded animal will make people flee the Democrats!
Congratulations to Danny Tarkanian on his big GOP primary win in Nevada. Danny worked hard an got a great result. Looking good in November!
A disgraceful verdict in the Kate Steinle case! No wonder the people of our Country are so angry with Illegal Immigration.
When will people start saying ‚Äúthank you Mr. President for firing James Comey?‚Äù
DRAIN THE SWAMP!
The Failing @nytimes the pipe organ for the Democrat Party has become a virtual lobbyist for them with regard to our massive Tax Cut Bill. They are wrong so often that now I know we have a winner!
Lightweight Senator @RandPaul should focus on trying to get elected in Kentucky--- a great state which is embarrassed by him.
At my meeting with Jay Powell this morning I protested fact that our Fed Rate is set too high relative to the interest rates of other competitor countries. In fact our rates should be lower than all others (we are the U.S.). Too strong a Dollar hurting manufacturers &amp; growth!
One of our best fundraising days EVER! 
Watching Senator Richard Blumenthal speak of Comey is a joke. "Richie" devised one of the greatest military frauds in U.S. history. For....
It's very sad that Republicans even some that were carried over the line on my back do very little to protect their President.
Thank you America! Together- we will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! 
Russian Collusion with the Trump Campaign one of the most successful in history is a TOTAL HOAX. The Democrats paid for the phony and discredited Dossier which was along with Comey McCabe Strzok and his lover the lovely Lisa Page used to begin the Witch Hunt. Disgraceful!
The Failing New York Times wrote another phony story. It was political pundit Doug Schoen not a Ukrainian businessman who asked me to do a short speech by phone (Skype) hosted by Doug in Ukraine. I was very positive about Ukraine-another negative to the Fake Russia  C story!
.@SteveHiltonx ‚ÄúThe Democrats statements about Donald Trump are lies. Here are the Facts.‚Äù I will soon be posting the entire segment. Too much positive news too many good things to Tweet. PLEASE BE SURE TO WATCH! Thank you Steve Hilton for being a real pro and not being afraid!
‚ÄúJames Comey has been rebuked at the highest level with much more to come. An IG Report doesn‚Äôt get any stronger calling him dangerous insubordinate. THANK GOODNESS THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS ELECTED BECAUSE IF HE WASN‚ÄôT ELECTED THESE PEOPLE WOULD STILL BE IN POWER. Two more.....
Good luck to Ric Grenell our new Ambassador to Germany. A great and talented guy he will represent our Country well!
Oh I get it! I am a very good developer happily living my life when I see our Country going in the wrong direction (to put it mildly). Against all odds I decide to run for President &amp; continue to run my business-very legal &amp; very cool talked about it on the campaign trail...

Have the Democrats finally realized that we desperately need Border Security and a Wall on the Southern Border. Need to stop Drugs Human TraffickingGang Members &amp; Criminals from coming into our Country. Do the Dems realize that most of the people not getting paid are Democrats?

I agree but in the end we will win and save our Country from certain destruction!

When a politician admits that ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to make America great again‚Äù there doesn‚Äôt seem to be much reason to ever vote for him. This could be a career threatening statement by Andrew Cuomo with many wanting him to resign-he will get higher ratings than his brother Chris!

Republicans cannot allow themselves to again lose the Senate seat in the Great State of Alabama. This time it will be for Six Years not just Two. I have NOTHING against Roy Moore and unlike many other Republican leaders wanted him to win. But he didn‚Äôt and probably won‚Äôt.....
....fiction to Congress and the American People?  I demand his deposition. He is a fraud just like the Russia Hoax was and the Ukraine Hoax is now. When do the Do Nothing Democrats pay a price for what they are doing to our Country &amp; when do the Republicans finally fight back?
We will never forget our fallen HEROES. It was our great honor to be with you today! #FlagsIn

The joint statement released with President Bolsonaro in March makes absolutely clear that I support Brazil beginning the process for full OECD membership. The United States stands by that statement and stands by @jairbolsonaro. This article is FAKE NEWS! 
The economy is looking really good. It has been many years that we have seen these kind of numbers. The underlying strength of companies has perhaps never been better.
Hillary Clinton is taking the day off again she needs the rest. Sleep well Hillary - see you at the debate!
I will be going to Texas as soon as that trip can be made without causing disruption. The focus must be life and safety.
I hope John Brennan the worst CIA Director in our country‚Äôs history brings a lawsuit. It will then be very easy to get all of his records texts emails and documents to show not only the poor job he did but how he was involved with the Mueller Rigged Witch Hunt. He won‚Äôt sue!

Wow the highest rated (by far) morning show @foxandfriends is on the Front Lawn of the White House. Maybe I‚Äôll have to take an unannounced trip down to see them?
The Democrats just don‚Äôt seem to want Border Security. They are fighting Border Agents recommendations. If you believe news reports they are not offering much for the Wall. They look to be making this a campaign issue. The Wall will get built one way or the other!
Will be doing a joint press conference in Hanoi Vietnam then heading for final destination of trip the Phillipines.
Russia Russia Russia! That‚Äôs all you heard at the beginning of this Witch Hunt Hoax...And now Russia has disappeared because I had nothing to do with Russia helping me to get elected. It was a crime that didn‚Äôt exist. So now the Dems and their partner the Fake News Media.....
So true but it will never work!

Nancy Pelosi just stated that ‚Äúit is dangerous to let the voters decide Trump‚Äôs fate.‚Äù @FoxNews  In other words she thinks I‚Äôm going to win and doesn‚Äôt want to take a chance on letting the voters decide. Like Al Green she wants to change our voting system. Wow she‚Äôs CRAZY!

Do you believe this kind of bravery? Amazing drug seizure. WATCH! 
Alan Dershowitz Harvard Law Professor: ‚ÄúIt all proves that we never needed a Special Councel....All of this could have been done by the Justice Dept. Don‚Äôt need a multi-million dollar group of people with a target on someone‚Äôs back. Not the way Justice should operate.‚Äù So true!
Comey drafted the Crooked Hillary exoneration long before he talked to her (lied in Congress to Senator G) then based his decisions on her poll numbers. Disgruntled he McCabe and the others committed many crimes!
Washington spent trillions building up foreign countries while allowing OUR OWN infrastructure to fall into a state of total disrepair. No more! It's time to REBUILD and we will do it with American WORKERS American GRIT and American PRIDE! 
Very few people read the National Review because it only knows how to criticize but not how to lead.
Required television watching is last weeks @marthamaccallum interview with the wonderful wife of Rod Blagojevich and the @trish_regan interview with a Jerome Corsi. If that doesn‚Äôt tell you something about what has been going on in our Country nothing will. Very sad!

Just landed - a long trip but everybody can now feel much safer than the day I took office. There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea. Meeting with Kim Jong Un was an interesting and very positive experience. North Korea has great potential for the future!

‚ÄúThe Obama Administration did not do itself proud in this.‚Äù @ByronYork 
‚ÄúIt was classified to cover up misconduct by the FBI and the Justice Department in misleading the Court by using this Dossier in a dishonest way to gain a warrant to target the Trump Team. This is a Clinton Campaign document. It was a fraud and a hoax designed to target Trump....
The riots in Charlottesville a year ago resulted in senseless death and division. We must come together as a nation. I condemn all types of racism and acts of violence. Peace to ALL Americans!
The Democrats are now alluding to the the concept that having an Informant placed in an opposing party‚Äôs campaign is different than having a Spy as illegal as that may be. But what about an ‚ÄúInformant‚Äù who is paid a fortune and who ‚Äúsets up‚Äù way earlier than the Russian Hoax?
So great that oil prices are falling (thank you President T). Add that which is like a big Tax Cut to our other good Economic news. Inflation down (are you listening Fed)!

Separating families at the Border is the fault of bad legislation passed by the Democrats. Border Security laws should be changed but the Dems can‚Äôt get their act together! Started the Wall.
Thank you San Diego County for defending the rule of law and supporting our lawsuit against California's illegal and unconstitutional 'Sanctuary' policies. California's dangerous policies release violent criminals back into our communities putting all Americans at risk.
